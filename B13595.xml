            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

                  </head>
                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T was the saying of the wisest among men, <hi>(high &amp; mighty Prince) In the multitude of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple is the Kings honor, but in the want of people is the destruction of a Prince.</hi> And for this cause as well the Law of <hi>God,</hi> as the constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of men haue hembd in the furious affections of vnruly and disorderly persons, lest to the detri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and danger of their neighbour, they should runne at randome beyond the rules of reason, in murthering and massacring him whom the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty had made according to his owne image and holinesse. Now as there is no crime so enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mious, but it may be masqued with the mantle of
<pb facs="tcp:2594:3"/> some vertue: so is there a sort of people who pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chasing to themselues credit, with the too-too cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulous multitude, doe vnder a plausible pretence of health, not onely sucke the substance from the deluded multitude, but often precipitate their bodies into <hi>Charons</hi> boat. Of whom a learned late Writer said well, that these people were more pernitious to a Common-wealth, then the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon cut-throats by the high-way sides. All which offenders are not a little encouraged, by the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary inspection of <hi>vrines,</hi> as it is at this day not without great preiudice to the publique, euery where practised.</p>
                  <p>Amongst many who haue stood in the gap a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst this abuse, none hath handled this subiect more plainly and to better purpose, then this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Author, whom for this cause I haue of a stranger vndertaken to make a Free-denizon, and to speake the language of this Land. As for my selfe, silence had beene more secure, and more safe for me to haue kept within the harbor, then to launce out into the deep and tempestuous Sea of mens censorious humours. But all the barkings and snarlings of the most enuious <hi>Momes</hi> &amp; <hi>Zoiles</hi> being weighed in the scales against the publique good, will bee found too light, being especially shrowded vnder the wings of so mighty a <hi>Maecoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nas</hi> as your selfe.</p>
                  <p>Neyther is it any new thing that great Princes haue beene affectioned fauourers of <hi>Physicke,</hi> and <hi>Physitians.</hi> Hence haue we the name of <hi>Mithri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dates</hi> daign'd vnto a noble Physicall compounded
<pb facs="tcp:2594:3"/> Antidote: of <hi>Gentius</hi> the <hi>Illyrian</hi> king to the hearb <hi>Gentian:</hi> of <hi>Lysimachus</hi> to the hearb <hi>Lysimachia,</hi> &amp;c But that I may come yet a little neerer, it is recor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that one of your <hi>Highnesse</hi> Ancestors, and sometimes King in the Northerne part of this Iland, composed certaine physicall Canons. And another King of the same descent is recor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to haue attained to that skill in curing of wounds <hi>(a branch of Surgery, being it selfe one of the parts of Physicke)</hi> that many noble Families of that Kingdome hauing from him acquired this skill, haue with their inheritances transmitted the same to their Successors. But hath not our bright morning starre, the purchaser of our <hi>peace,</hi> of whom your <hi>Highnes</hi> hath his being, and on whom the eyes of the <hi>European Princes</hi> are now set, as in other Arts and liberall Sciences, so likewise in this Profession, manifested so profound knowledge, as one would thinke the oracle of <hi>Aesculapius</hi> had beene committed to his custody? And as the great Commander of this Vniuerse hath singled you out for a Successor to so great Countries and Kingdomes; so doe I not doubt but he will make you such a patterne of pietie, and endue you with so noble and heroicall vertues, fit for so high and mighty a calling, as the after-ages shall haue cause to blesse the memory of your name.</p>
                  <p>And if names <hi>(howsoeuer of no validity in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues)</hi> doe yet often call to minde the noble ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues and heroicall exploits of our Predecessors, and incite vs to a laudable imitation of the same: of what name shall we finde more magnanimous and
<pb facs="tcp:2594:4"/> couragious Champions, and better acquainted with the affaires of <hi>Mars</hi> and <hi>Minerua?</hi> Amongst many I will single out but three, which shall serue in stead of many moe.</p>
                  <p>The noble and heroicall exploits of that euer-renowned worthy Champion <hi>Charles Martell</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruing eternall memory, the famous <hi>Tours</hi> can yet testifie; whereas aboue three hundred and seuenty thousand of the miscreant <hi>Saracenicall nation,</hi> did affright not onely <hi>France,</hi> but euen <hi>Italy</hi> it selfe, and the <hi>Pope</hi> notwithstanding his triple Crowne, with all his Clergy, was not a little amazed; and yet were by this valiant Champion vtterly ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown, leauing their dead carkeises for a testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie of his triumphant victory. It would be too tedious to relate the rest of his heroicall acts and exploits, as well against the fore-named Nation, as many others also.</p>
                  <p>But if I should enter vpon the acts of him who descended lineally out of his loynes in the second generation, that noble <hi>Charles,</hi> called, and that not without cause, <hi>Great,</hi> as he was not in word but in very deed also, I scarce should know where to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginne. And howbeit his famous acts against the <hi>Saxons</hi> and <hi>Saracens,</hi> and sundry other nations, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the managing of the Westerne Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, were great and glorious: yet were they farre inferiour to his other acts in planting and propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gating true pietie; witnesse the foundation of so many Churches and religious places, with rents and reuennues alotted for the maintaining of the seruice of the Almighty. So farre did this magna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimous
<pb facs="tcp:2594:4"/> Monarch differ from the iudgement of the ascrilegious Church-robbing Great-men of our dayes. What shall I say of his singular loue to let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and learned men? witnesse the founding of the two famous Vniuersities of <hi>Paris</hi> and <hi>Pauie.</hi> As for his religious life in priuate, his constant and carefull performance of the duties of pietie, they are but seldome to be seene in Princes of that emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nency and might. So that of him I may iustly say that he deserueth to be paralleld with the greatest Princes, and to be enrolled among the Worthies of the world.</p>
                  <p>Another great and mighty <hi>Charles</hi> the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an world hath of later dayes produced: I meane that famous Emperour, the fift of that name, the glory of the <hi>Austrian</hi> House. Whose valiant ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploits against both <hi>Christians</hi> and <hi>Infidels,</hi> together with the captiuating of the <hi>French</hi> King had made his name and fame immortall: if hee had not too basely abandoned himselfe to the performance of the will and pleasure of the Pope and his Shaue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, especially those lawlesse Locusts, I meane the <hi>Loiolites,</hi> the Pharisies of our age, and in blind zeale bathed his Blade in the blood of his most faithfull and trusty Subiects: whom therefore God suffered to be pursued by his owne Subiect <hi>Maurice</hi> Duke of <hi>Saxony,</hi> by whom also hee was forced to yeeld to such conditions as did much of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuscate the splendor of his former victories. And would to God that great <hi>Henry</hi> of <hi>France</hi> of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous memory, hauing taken warning by the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt which lighted on his teeth, and not being
<pb facs="tcp:2594:5"/> circumuented by the soft and woolly words of that cunning <hi>Coton,</hi> had not suffered those infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Furies euer to take footing any more in that famous Kingdome of <hi>France,</hi> then perhaps, had wee not had these fires of dissention kindled, nor heard that one Subiect should vnsheath his sword to bath it in his Christian brothers blood. And I hope that the Princes and Potentates of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian world will now learne to be wise, and to bee warned by other mens harmes. But to our <hi>Charles</hi> againe, I thinke it may well bee said of him as of <hi>Dauids</hi> Worthies, that he was honourable among many, yet attained not to the former two. But one thing yet worthy remembrance in this worthy Prince I cannot passe by; that when as that scar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let Whore, by her fawning and flattering demea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, had drawne the affections of this Prince to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards her, &amp; according to her accustomed change<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ablenesse and mutability (especially when greater gaine is offered) shewing him a tricke of her old trade, in entertaining another louer: this generous Prince not able to digest so hainous iniuries, did captiuate the triple Crowne, sacking the seat and City of this abominable Beast, and discharging the Papall authority through all the Spanish Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions, left worthy president to all posterity, that the Kingdome of <hi>Spaine,</hi> as well as her neighbour Nations, could make a pretty shift without the Papall power.</p>
                  <p>In these three Worthies all manner of morall vertues, as also whatsoeuer concerneth either mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary or Martiall discipline, together with the

Now your <hi>Highnesse</hi> accustomed clemency and courteous entertainment of learning with the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours of the learned, haue emboldned me, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit the meanest among many more able and suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient then my selfe, to present vnto your <hi>High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse</hi> these my rude labours; the which not my selfe alone, but many more of refined iudgement, haue thought fit to publish for the good of the publique.</p>
                  <p>Let it therefore please your <hi>Princely</hi> patience to accept of this first part of the first fruits of my labours, vntill the second part may see the light of the Sunne, which likewise longeth for, and relieth vpon the patronage of so great a <hi>Prince;</hi> beseech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing your <hi>Highnesse</hi> to accept of it, not according to the worth, but the will and good affection of him who doth present it. Thus did our gracious God in the building of the Tabernacle, accept as well of Goats haire and Badgers skinnes, as of sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, and gold, and precious stones, scarlet, purple, blew, and fine linnen. And the poore Widowes mite was accepted of according to the bountiful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
<pb facs="tcp:2594:6"/> of her mind. The mighty Monarch <hi>Artax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erxes</hi> also accepted kindly at the hand of <hi>Sinetas</hi> the <hi>Persian</hi> his entertainment with a cup of cold water taken out of the Riuer <hi>Cyrus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now being conscious to my selfe, that my good and forward affection is nothing inferior, hauing no better gift for the present, I hope this my paines shall find no worse entertainment at your <hi>Highnesse</hi> hands. And thus shall I pray for your <hi>Highnesse</hi> happy and prosperous estate; with the abundance of all good things in this life, and endlesse happinesse in the life to come: and shall euer remaine</p>

Amongst many others, the abuses committed in the iudgement of diseases by the inspection of the <hi>vrine</hi> onely, haue beene so great and so many, that for the subduing of the same is required the helpe of some mighty <hi>Hercules.</hi> Amongst diuers others who haue opposed themselues against the sayd errors and abuses, none haue more fully, and more pertinently handled this subiect then this our Author. And because the vulgar sort of people is most subiect to be ensnared, and most obuious to euery error, my chiefe ayme and end therefore hath beene, as much as in me lyeth, to free them from imposture and cozenage, by communicating to them this Treatise in our owne vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar tongue. It cannot indeed be denied that <hi>vrines</hi> haue for many yeares beene most basely abused. If I should say that in this Kingdome this abuse hath not a little beene improued, I thinke I should say nothing besides the truth. Witnesse so many ignorant <hi>Empirickes, women-phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitians,</hi> with a many of our saucy <hi>Surgeons,</hi> and many moe, who by their pretended and supposed skill in the

But at this I doe not so much maruell, but rather to see some of the Tribe of <hi>Leui,</hi> who should sound out with their voyces like Trumpets against all sinnes, to be themselues inuolued in this sinne of <hi>Couetousnesse.</hi> For whatsoeuer other pretence they make, it may plainly appeare, that it is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing else but a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>arment of figge leaues which will neuer couer their nakednesse. Is it not apparent that many of our <hi>Parsons</hi> and <hi>Vicars</hi> in this Kingdome, as though they were of the secret counsell of <hi>Aesculapius,</hi> or had digged out of the graue the ghost of that famous <hi>Hippo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates,</hi> or else with some <hi>Pythagoricall</hi> translation of the soules of all the most famous <hi>Physitians,</hi> the skill were conueyed vnto them; they haue like vsurpers, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truded vpon other mens right? Now that preaching of the word, with the dependances of the same, and practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of <hi>Physicke,</hi> are in the word of God two seuerall distinct callings, I thinke cannot be denied. And in the second place, that the practice of the one hindreth the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of the other as it ought: those that well weigh the weight of both callings, their seuerall subiects, large extents, paines, and labour to be imployed about either of them, must needs confesse, that whosoeuer will conscio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably performe the worke of the Ministery as hee ought, shall therein finde worke enough without medling with the health of the body. And besides, the preiudice to the common good, may hence euidently appeare, that often at one and the same instant, each of these callings demandeth his personall presence.</p>
                  <p>All the charge our Lord and Sauiour gaue to <hi>Peter,</hi>
                     <pb facs="tcp:2594:8"/> was to feed his flocke, and that reiterated three seuerall times. And this was the charge committed to all the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles and other Ministers of the word. As for the curing of Diseases, it was both miraculous and lasted but for a time, they being as free from couetousnesse and pecuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary traffique, as ours at this time are addicted vnto the same. The holy Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> willeth euery man <hi>to abide in the same calling</hi> (not <hi>callings) wherein hee was called:</hi> and in another place; <hi>Ministers must wait on the Ministery:</hi> and, <hi>Let euery man meddle with his businesse with quietnesse.</hi> Now how small account so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer these men make of the ministeriall function, the charge is so great, and the account so strict, that Saint <hi>Chrysostome</hi> saith, <hi>He wondreth that any Bishop or Minister can be saued. Ammonius</hi> also being vrged with a Bishopricke, cut off his right eare, that such defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity might be a Canonicall impediment. May it not then plainly appeare that <hi>Ye take too much vpon you, ye Sonnes of Leui.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Their colourable excuse of doing good to their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, is to small purpose: for then were it lawfull for euery man to meddle with another mans profession, then might the <hi>Lawyer</hi> become a <hi>Physitian,</hi> the <hi>Physitian</hi> a <hi>Diuine,</hi> and the <hi>Diuine</hi> all three. Indeed the <hi>Lawyer</hi> hath likewise some cause to complaine: for some of our <hi>Parsons,</hi> I heare, are busied with making Wils and Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, Deeds, and Conueyances, and what not? But the <hi>Lawyer</hi> is old enough to plead his owne cause. But God is the God of order, not of confusion; and neuer did allow of this confused <hi>Chaos</hi> of callings.</p>

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> these men are iustly to be blamed, so in like manner such as are occasions of their distractions must
<pb facs="tcp:2594:9"/> needs also deserue some reprehensions. It is not the part of an honest man either to incourage or countenance so pernicious distractions and confusions in a Christian Common-wealth. The Princely Prophet <hi>Dauid</hi> would not drinke of the water that was purchased with the perill of mens liues. And is it not apparent that these mens negligence endangereth the soules of their flockes, while they care most for their fleeces.</p>
                  <p>But it is easier for me to reprehend this disorder, then to amend it. Would to God those that haue the salue would apply it to this sore; to the end that this foule <hi>Vlcer</hi> spread it selfe no further to the annoyance both of Church and Common-wealth. As for my selfe, the loue and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect I beare vnto the publique good, together with the vindicating of our <hi>Aesculapian</hi> Art from abuse as much as in me lyeth, haue beene the chiefe meanes which mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued me to impart these my paines to the publique, being not a little animated hereunto by the Author himselfe, who towards the latter end of this Discourse hopeth for the publication thereof in vulgar tongues. Howbeit I doe not deny but I haue euer beene as auerse as any from the publication of any such <hi>Physicke</hi> bookes in our vulgar tongue, as might giue the least incouragement to ignorant Droanes and Dunces, wherewith this Kingdome doth so abound. And I haue euer wished that some of our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession would employ their paines to some better purpose. For as the inspection of <hi>Vrines,</hi> as it is now practised is one; so is the writing or translating of <hi>Physick</hi> practicall books in the English tongue another bād which much em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boldneth this kind of people to proceed in their erronious course. As for that idle and more then threed-bare ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection of the pleaders for this abuse, it is of no force nor
<pb facs="tcp:2594:9"/> validity; to wit, that the abuse ought not to take away the right vse of the same: For while as the Booke pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribeth a remedy for the disease in generall, yet can the ignorant Reader neuer thereby collect the seuerall cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances in such a case to be obserued; as the constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the patient, the manifold causes which may either inhibit the exhibiting, or yet indicate the altering thereof in quantity, quality, or both, with many moe circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, which are so many and so diuers, that they require no vulgar vnderstanding to find them out; howsoeuer, such remedies, how absurd soeuer, may at sometimes be seconded by a prosperous and wished for successe: which being but casuall, the cleere sighted vnderstanding will neuer trust to And therefore it may plainly appeare that there can be no right vse of such Bookes. Besides, that they proue often occasions of procrastinating and putting off the time and opportunity of asking sound and learned aduice, vntill such time as irrecouerable occasion be past, and <hi>He that would not when he might, now may not when he would.</hi> And whereas the pleaders for this practice would seeme to haue gotten ground on vs by sheltring themselues vnder the shield of the ancient <hi>Greeke</hi> Physitians, to wit, that they follow the footsteps of the famous ancient Fathers, <hi>Hippocrates, Galen,</hi> and his Apish imitator <hi>Paulus Aegineta,</hi> with many moe: It is true that these worthy ancient Writers to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagate to posterity the precepts and rules of Art, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with manifold remedies, did couch them in the <hi>Greeke</hi> tongue, the which howbeit it was their vulgar and common speech, yet neither was it their intent that they should be diuulged abroad amongst the vulgar peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, neither yet could it then be so preiudiciall as now

Good reason had they to write them in the <hi>Greeke</hi> tongue, as being very famous, and by reason of the <hi>Macedonian Monarchy</hi> vnder <hi>Alexander</hi> and his successors, besides <hi>Europe,</hi> it was farre spread in <hi>Asia,</hi> and the copiousnesse and elegancy gaue it no small grace and estimation among many Nations. Now that it was neuer the intent of these learned men that those Bookes which contained the whole mysteries of this Art should be diuulged abroad, may plainly appeare to all such as will not be obstinately ignorant, by the carefull keeping of them in their Temples and Oratories, their <hi>Priests</hi> and <hi>Southsayers</hi> taking charge of them: as likewise that all who did professe and practise this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession neere the space of a thousand yeares, were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scended of the linage of old <hi>Aesculapius;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their intent and purpose was onely to haue them inuiolably kept for their successors to be trained vp in the same profession. And againe, that there was no such danger of diuulging them abroad in those dayes is manifest, in that the vse of printing was not many hundreds of yeares after this knowne, by which means (saith a learned man) more may be in one day di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spatched, then by more mens writings in a whole yeare.</p>
                  <p>Now among many other Physicke practicall Bookes some of our <hi>vrine bookes</hi> written in the English tongue, haue not a little emboldened a many ignorant busie-bodies <hi>to thrust their sickle into another mans haruest.</hi> Hence comes it to passe, that any idle old trot, Cobler, or Costardmonger, vpon the reading of such a booke will seem to pronounce some <hi>Delphian</hi> oracle by the <hi>vrine.</hi> The greatnesse of which abuse so
<pb facs="tcp:2594:11"/> much encreased in this Kingdome, hath occasioned me to take this cause in hand. And because it doth chiefly ayme at the informing and rectifying of the iudgement of the deluded multitude, I am so farre from affecting a high and strained style, that I haue euen accommodated my words as much as I could to the capacitie of the meanest. And if this finde kinde entertainment at thy hand (kinde Reader) then shall I be incouraged to publish vnto thy view another part concerning the same subiect, which I haue my selfe collected out of a great number of ancient and late Writers, the chiefe contents whereof shall be these:</p>
                  <p>The Tractate being diuided into two bookes, in the first shall be contained the authorities of some learned Physitians against this abuse in generall, and then shall the vncertainty of this signe be seene in some in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities where it is thought to be of greatest force. Then shall follow a confutation of the vulgar opinion of discerning of women with childe, as also of the sexe by the <hi>vrine:</hi> all illustrated by the authorities of the learned at large, with pregnant proofes, and vnan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerable arguments, wherunto are added some things desumed from mine owne experimentall knowledge. In the second I proceed to a more particular suruey first of the regions of the <hi>vrine,</hi> then to the substance, quantity and qualitie: and in the qualities, first to the smell, then the chiefe colours of <hi>vrines,</hi> together with their manifold seuerall strange contents: not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting the circle or garland, spume or froath, and bubbles, with other contents swimming on the top. And before the Conclusion shall follow the fond and foolish conceit &amp; opinion of some doating Alchymists
<pb facs="tcp:2594:12"/> of our times concerning the distillation of <hi>vrines.</hi> All which shall be prosecuted after the foresaid plaine and perspicuous Method.</p>
                  <p>I intreat thee therefore (courteous Reader) that thou wouldest be pleased to accept this my paines in as good part, as I haue beene willing to impart the same vnto thee for thy vse and profit. And if thou wilt set partialitie and by-respects aside, I make no doubt but thou shalt see, and plainly perceiue, that the great en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest here mentioned shall finde it <hi>billa vera.</hi> And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause I would take away all excuses from the delin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quents, and lest with the Iewes they shall say <hi>Doth our Law condemne a man before he be heard,</hi> I will therefore deferre the further prosecuting of this businesse vntill another Assize, to see if the offenders can say any thing for themselues. So ceasing to abuse thy patience any longer, and entreating thy charita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble censure of this my rude labour, I will here take my leaue of thee vntill the next occasion.</p>

                     <p>IN these three bookes the Author taketh great paines to demonstrate by solid and vnanswerable arguments, of whom, and what manner of Physi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian it is best and safest to aske counsell, if at any time we shall be seazed with sicknes: to wit, not of base ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant Empirickes, vrine-mongers, water-prophets, women-physitians, and such like: but rather of the learned, skilfull and iudicious Physitian, trained vp and well experienced in his Profession. In the first Booke therefore is declared that the iudgement of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eases by the sole inspection of the vrine, is very vncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine and deceitfull, as also sometimes not without great danger. And to the end that this may more plainly appeare to the eyes of euery one, it is declared in the first place, what vrine is, and of what manner of substance it is engendred: as also, after what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner the humours are sequestred in the preparation of the blood. Afterwards also are described, the super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluities that are ingendred of the same. The causes of Vrines in euery respect of the best and most laudable note, are afterwards set downe. In the last place is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued and concluded, that the iudgement had by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spection of Vrine onely, is not sufficient to giue vs full notice of the whole nature and circumstances of the disease, as ignorant people are for the most part (though falsly) perswaded.</p>

                        <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>O the end that these things may be the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter by vs vnderstood, wee are to consider in the first place, that euery part of the body of man hath an <hi>attractiue</hi> or drawing power,<note place="margin">The attractiue faculty.</note> by vertue of which it doth natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally draw vnto it selfe such nourishment as is proper and peculiar for the same. This office is performed some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times by meanes of some small straight fleshy haires, or threeds as in the stomacke: sometimes againe this office is performed by the sole temperature of the part onely, as commeth to passe in the rest of the parts of the body: and sometimes againe for the delight and pleasure of the part; and thus the mouth of the wombe draweth the seed of the man vnto it selfe. Moreouer, in the next place, the part is also endued with a <hi>retentiue</hi> or retaining facultie,<note place="margin">The retentiue facultie.</note> to the end it might retaine the same vntill such time as the concoction be finished, if it be nourishment, or if excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, vntill such time as streching and reaching out the said part by the great quantity, or else by the sharpe and biting quality, or both iointly, it doth grieue and annoy the part, as manifestly is to be seene in those parts which containe a great hollownesse; such as bee the stomacke, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>he guts, the mother, and the bladder: and after the same manner is the infant contained in the wombe, as is the meat in the stomacke, vntill such time as either by the bignesse, the waight, the sharpnesse of the sweat, or vrine of the infant, the cotyledons, or mouthes of the small veines being burst, or yet any other causes vrging or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoking
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:2594:16"/> the same, it bee forced to let goe the poore prisoner.</p>
                     <p>The third is the <hi>concocting</hi> faculty,<note place="margin">The cōcocting faculty.</note> which changeth the nourishment into the owne proper substance, but yet af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter diuers and sundry wayes; for blood is speedily conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into flesh, but the bone as being cold and dry hath need of many moe alterations and changes. Hence also it commeth to passe that there are two sorts of helps and aydes assisting nourishment;<note place="margin">Two sorts of helpes and aydes to nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishment.</note> the one which draweth the nourishment, conueyeth, containeth, and concocteth it, and then as too heauy a burthen expelleth the same.

The other sort of ayd and helpe, is that which in drawing the excrement vnto it selfe, doth separate, conuey, retaine, and in due and conuenient time expell the same; such are <hi>the Spleene, the Kidneis, both the Bladders, together with their orifices and concauities, the Guts, especially the greater, the two muscles called Sphyncters, the eight epigastricall muscles, those muscles also which keepe in the breath,</hi> being of no small vse and profit, yea and sometimes necessary also, both in regard of the excretion of the ordure and vrine, as of the birth also. That which by this nourishing alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration doth glide vnto such parts as are already framed and made, is assimilated or made like vnto the same; and for this cause properly called <hi>assimilation.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Assimilation.</note> But by an engen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring alteration, such parts are made and framed as were not before.</p>
                     <p>The fourth and the last, is that which wee commonly call <hi>the expelling faculty.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">The expelling faculty.</note> Now when as it doth naturally expell such things as cannot be ouercome, concocted, perfectly changed and conuerted into the substance of
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:2594:16"/> that part, especially such as are too-too burdensome, and doe distend and stretch out the part by too great a quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, or yet by their sharpe quality, or both together, are noi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some and offensiue, it is then said well and handsomely to expell the same. This expulsion is likewise furthered by meanes of the <hi>ouerthwart fibres or fleshy haires</hi> in such parts as they are found, <hi>as namely in the stomacke, the guts, both the bladders, as well that of the gall, as of the vrine, the veines and arteries. Expulsion</hi> being contrary to <hi>Attraction,</hi> is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes notwithstanding performed by the same passa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, as casting and swallowing by the throat; the seed of generation and the birth by <hi>the necke of the mother;</hi> the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stribution of the food and nourishment, the attraction of purging physicke, and the naturall voluntary expulsion of that superfluous humour into the guts, by <hi>the miserai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call veines.</hi> Now these foure faculties, together with their seuerall functions, being vnderstood aright, the manner of the generation of the bloud will bee more plaine and conspicuous. The food being first well bruised by the teeth thereto appointed, is drawne downe into the sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macke or <hi>maw,</hi> by the <hi>throat;</hi> and being there for a certaine space retained, it is afterwards concocted into the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of a cream-like humour called <hi>chylus,</hi> and from thence doth it expell the same into the guts, which in some part doe retaine it, altering, changing, and conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting some part of the same into a substance fit for their owne nourishment, and afterwards doe expell the super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluities, when as they are ouercharged with the abundance, or yet annoyed with the acrimony and sharpnesse of the same. In the meane while the <hi>miseraicall veines</hi> hauing their originall from the <hi>liuer</hi> it selfe, by meanes of the <hi>bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy or porter veine,</hi> and are implanted in the guts them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, doe sucke, and as it were, milke or straine from them this concocted nourishment, (which <hi>Physitians</hi> doe call <hi>chymus</hi>) drawing and conueying the same vnto the hollow parts of the <hi>liuer,</hi> presenting the same to the san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guifying or blood-making quality, and if there come no
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:2594:17"/> rub or let in the way, the same is conuerted and changed into <hi>blood,</hi> and that afterwards more exquisitly elaborate and refined by the <hi>blood-making</hi> power of the <hi>liuer,</hi> as is at length to be seene in <hi>Galen</hi> and diuers others after him. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thus then conueyed to the <hi>liuer,</hi> then ariseth as it were, <hi>a boyling, digestion, and generation of the seuerall humours.</hi> This <hi>Galen</hi> illustrates by a familiar example,<note place="margin">Gal. lib. <hi>4.</hi> de vsu part. &amp; lib. de natur. facul.</note> euen as in the new wine is the <hi>spume or froth swimming aboue, the dregs, the watrish humour, and that which is properly called blood:</hi> so likewise in the humours there is a <hi>spume</hi> or <hi>froth</hi> called by the name of <hi>choler,</hi> another crud, yet halfe concocted hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour (to speake Physically) yet in election to bee <hi>blood,</hi> commonly called <hi>phlegme.</hi> There is yet moreouer another thicke and dreggy, commonly called <hi>melancholy.</hi> Now that which wee properly call <hi>blood,</hi> answering to the proper substance of wine, doth differ from the foresaid humours.

The manner of the separation of the same is thus brought to passe: The blood being now prepared, and the motion and agitation or perturbation of it being finished, the little bag appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to receiue <hi>choler,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">The vsed vtility of the gal-bag.</note> and adhering close to the inner lap or lobe of the <hi>liuer,</hi> draweth vnto it selfe that which is ligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test and thinnest, to wit, <hi>choler,</hi> so called, and that for di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers needfull and necessary vses; as first, to ease and free the body from that superfluous humour; next, to wash and clense the guts, the better and easilier to expell the fecall excrements.</p>

                     <p>When therefore there is any obstruction in that place, in such sort is this <hi>choler</hi> cannot haue a free passage into the guts, it returneth backe speedily into the <hi>gall-bag,</hi> from thence to the <hi>liuer,</hi> after that to the veines proceeding from the <hi>liuer,</hi> and then consequently passing through the same, and like sweat, piercing through the <hi>pores,</hi> or little holes of the skinne, dyes the same all ouer with a yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low colour; and then are the excrements, for the most part, whitish, costiuenesse being likewise ioyned with the same, for the reason before alledged.</p>

                     <p>And finally, from the <hi>spleene</hi> is stretched forth a little <hi>veiny vessell</hi> (called by the Anatomists <hi>vas breue</hi>) vnto the mouth of the stomacke, which conueyes thither some part of this melancholicke humour, to the end that the appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite may thereby be quickned, and the stomacke bound vp and strengthned.</p>

                     <p>There are then foure seuerall concoctions, performed in the foure seuerall parts of the body.<note place="margin">Foure conco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions in mans body.</note> The first in the <hi>sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macke</hi> or <hi>maw:</hi> the second in the <hi>branchy veine,</hi> in the <hi>mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raicall veines,</hi> and in the hollow part of the <hi>liuer:</hi> the third, in the <hi>gibbous</hi> or crooked part of the same, and the veines which come from thence: the last is in the vtmost parts of the body.

<pb n="11" facs="tcp:2594:19"/> of man, is not my purpose here to discourse, as being at great length handled in many great volumes of the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent and moderne Physitians. The superfluity of the third concoction<note place="margin">Of the third concoction.</note> is the <hi>vrine,</hi> (the proper substance of this dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, and cause of the vndertaking of this taske) as also such things as are contained in the substance of the same: of the which hereafter, so farre forth as they shall make for our purpose, we will speake.<note place="margin">Of the fourth concoction.</note> Now in the fourth and last, do superabound as well such vapours as do by insen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible transpiration issue out of the body, as the other seene sensibly, sometimes more, and sometimes lesse, to burst forth of the body, called commonly by the name of <hi>sweat.</hi> Of all the premisses, as also of many other things belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thereto, are altogether ignorant our <hi>ordinary vrine-mongers, Empirickes,</hi> and <hi>women-Physitians,</hi> and many <hi>or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Practitioners of Physicke,</hi> who haue perhaps attained to some small smattering of learning, and yet haue neuer beene instructed in this profound faculty.</p>
                     <p>But to come now to the marrow of the matter: if all these former concoctions be performed as they ought, then hath the <hi>vrine</hi> the right and proper colour and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, the contents in like manner doe keepe their owne proper place, <hi>the residence being white, smooth,</hi>

                        <hi>and of an equall substance.</hi> And this manner of <hi>vrine</hi> is best to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scerned, when it commeth from a man in euery respect temperate, and of a <hi>pale-golden,</hi> or <hi>Orange</hi> colour, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swering in proportion of quantity, to that he drinketh. If it shall so come to passe that any of the foresaid concocti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons doe erre, then is the <hi>vrine</hi> also altered, teaching and instructing vs to find out by what causes the same is chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged. For the superfluity of the humour that passeth through the whole body, being sequestred in the <hi>vrine,</hi> may be often seene in the vrinall. The errors committed in this kind may easily be conceiued of by the like in Vl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers:<note place="margin">An example from Vlcers.</note> for if the matter which commeth from the same be white and smooth hauing little or no ill smell at all,<note place="margin">Gal. lib. <hi>1.</hi> de differ. sch. cap. <hi>6.</hi>

<pb n="12" facs="tcp:2594:20"/> a good concoction or ripening of the same. If any of the foresaid conditions be wanting, it argueth that the concoction hath missed of its perfection: in so much that hence we may guesse if any malignity be crept into the Vlcer, if the concoction be hindred, if it grow black, or suffer any thing more or lesse, answering alike to the fault of the concoction. The like also we may see in the <hi>vrines</hi> (witnesse <hi>Galen,</hi> with whom doth <hi>Actuarius</hi> also agree) that according to the concoction of the humours, the <hi>sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, colour,</hi> and <hi>contents,</hi> doe change.</p>

The <hi>vrine</hi> then made about this time doth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly retaine its owne proper vigour and force, for if it be longer kept, it is parched vp and dried with heat, from whence it commeth to passe that the liuely colour of the same is changed. Besides, in the night time the conco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction is much better performed then in the day, the body being then freed from immoderate and violent exercises, as also the mind more free from cares and all manner of perturbations. Hence also it commeth to passe that wee may more easily and euidently know either security or danger by that <hi>vrine</hi> which is made in the morning then by that which was made either after or yet a long time before.

                     <p>The reason of this vncertainty is, because the <hi>contents, bubbles,</hi> or <hi>spume</hi> and <hi>residence,</hi> are so shuffled out of their owne proper places, and so confounded, that they cannot well be discerned.

<pb n="35" facs="tcp:2594:33"/> then much more suspected.

                     <p>Some things there are also from the which the <hi>vrine</hi> must be kept,<note place="margin">The Vrine must be kept from shaking and motion, as also from cold.</note> to the end thou mayest giue the more assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and setled iudgement concerning the same.

                     <p>Now to our purpose: the vncertainty of the <hi>Vrine</hi> did plainly appeare to my selfe,<note place="margin">History.</note> the other day in a Patient I went to visit at the <hi>Hage.</hi> At my comming thither, and entring into the Hall, before I came at himselfe, I viewed his water, and found it to be very thin, white, and cleare like well-water: Insomuch as I would neuer haue drea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of any <hi>burning Feuer,</hi> of the which neuerthelesse they told me he lay sicke.

                     <p>This cozenage costs them but little labour, and easily become they maisters in this Mystery; for if they can but by their tricks and cunning iuggling imposture fish out any thing of these poore Country ignorant Asses, they will like Parrats prate of the same againe at great length, perswading by this meanes the silly and simple ignorant multitude (apt euer to bee carried away more with sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes and shewes then substances) that they farre exceed the most learned and experienced <hi>Physitians,</hi> all their skill notwithstanding being nothing else but meer coniectures &amp; impostorious deluding of the simpler sort.

He answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red her, <hi>that she was not at all so much as conceiued with childe, but that for certaine she was bewitched, and that by such a one, as hee would haue sworne would neuer haue committed so wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked a fact: and did moreouer protest with great Oathes, that
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:2594:53"/> none besides himselfe was able to cure her.</hi> In the Cure he was very desirous to haue ioyned with himselfe a certaine Coniurer, who should daily mumble and mutter I know not what ouer the sicke womans head. Then would he himselfe administer vnto her certaine Physicall Potions, after the vse whereof shee should so perfectly recouer, that there should not the least remainder of her disease after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards appeare: <hi>And if thou wilt</hi> (saith the Villaine) <hi>I will goe with thee to see thy Mistrisse.</hi> The maid hauing her wits about her, said, that this was beyond her commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but that shee would first know her Mistrisses pleasure. The sicke woman being seasoned with true Religion and piety, would in no wise admit of any Coniurer, resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing rather to commit her selfe vnto the hands of God &amp; good <hi>Physitians,</hi> then to haue any dealing with such iug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling knaues, and yet some of her friends were very instant with her to vse the counsell of this cozener. A few dayes after her Husband my Cousin commeth to mee to <hi>Alc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mare,</hi> where I then practised Physicke, bringing with him his wiues <hi>vrine,</hi> and withall acquainted mee with the whole manner of her disease, together with all the acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents and circumstances thereof vntill that present time. After I had well viewed the <hi>Water,</hi> perceiuing it to bee thin and cleare, with a leaden coloured circle, and small residence, I was of opinion there was great crudity in the <hi>stomacke,</hi> occasioning bad concoction therein; for such an <hi>vrine</hi> doth most commonly argue some obstructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the <hi>spleene,</hi> giuing notice also of <hi>melancholy:</hi> for this cause I did so much the more suspect that shee was oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed with <hi>melancholy,</hi> hearing especially that shee had in her all the signes which <hi>Galen</hi> writes to accompany this <hi>hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chondriacke melancholy.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Gal. lib. de locis affect. cap. <hi>5.</hi> &amp; <hi>6</hi>
                        </note> So both by the <hi>vrine</hi> and Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands narration, I did collect that shee was troubled with this disease.</p>
                     <p>After many words to and fro betwixt vs, hee asked of mee whether I thought it meete they should follow the <hi>Empiricks</hi> counsaile or no: I answered, that in any case
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:2594:54"/> they should beware of the same, and did further by many strong and forcible arguments and reasons, disswade him from suffering his wife to vse any such strong violent pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging Physicke, prescribed either by <hi>Empiricke</hi> or yet any other, how skilfull and learned soeuer he were, there being especially some suspition of being with childe. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore my counsell vvas that shee should for a certaine time abstain likewise from any thing which might prouoke any loathing or distast to her stomacke, and to bee very cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumspect for feare of procuring aborsion. But in case she was troubled with the violence of any fierce and sharpe accidents, I wished him to aske the opinion of some lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and iudicious <hi>Physitian,</hi> and yet to beware of offering any violence to Nature. I appointed her therefore a good and wholsome forme of Dyet, as also some milde and gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle remedies fitted well for the purpose notwithstanding, and without any feare of offending her childe, with the which I sent her husband home.</p>
                     <p>Not very long after his returne homewards, shee was brought to bed of a faire daughter, and immediately after was wholly freed from her former infirmity. Where was now I pray you this bewitching vvhich this vvretched iugling <hi>Priest</hi> did prognosticate by the <hi>vrine?</hi> What if this vvoman had vsed his desperate remedies? had not this Rakehell killed as vvell the Mother as the Childe? vvhich now through God his goodnesse haue escaped this bloudy Butchers hands.</p>
                     <p>Many more examples could I produce concerning the grosse errors in this kinde committed by these <hi>Sycophant-water-prophets;</hi> but this for the present shall suffice, lest the Booke should grow to an excessiue bignesse, if stusted too full of such trash. But still this holdeth firme and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>answerable, that the <hi>water-guessing</hi> vvhich <hi>Empiricks</hi> and such others vse, is nothing else but meere imposture and cozenage.</p>

                     <p>These people are so bewitched with these iugling and lying knaues, that oftentimes they will confesse to see that which they see not at all,<note place="margin">Blockish assen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</note> as I haue heard them tell of <hi>Ʋ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lispiegle,</hi> who at a certaine time perswaded a many people gathered together, that the wals of the house were all painted, when as yet there was no such matter, and yet none of all the company contradicted him saue one silly simple woman reputed for a foole.

                     <p>Now to make this more plainly appeare, I will here re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late a ridiculous, but yet true story which was told mee by an Apothecary in <hi>France.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">A pretty merry story of a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try Clowne de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding to know by the vrine how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny rounds his wife had falne off a ladder.</note> A Country Clowne at a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine time brought to a Physitian, an <hi>vrine</hi> to looke vpon, and it being then winter and hard frost, he first dissolued it at the heat of the fire. The Physitian obseruing the fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes simplicity, demanded of him whether it were not his wiues <hi>water.</hi> The fellow answered that it was so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, but yet wished him to take a narrow view, and to tell him what he could further see in the same. The Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitian looking narrowly, obseruing it to be of a reasonable good colour, beganne to suspect some outward paine or ache. The Country Lob hearing of a paine, applauded the Physitians iudgement for the same. But from whence
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:2594:56"/> proceedeth (said he) this great paine of a leaden and blac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kish colour, which doth so vncessantly torment her sides? The Physitian hearing mention made of a leaden blackish colour, it was no hard matter for him to coniecture that it came eyther by some fall or blow: wherefore he asked the fellow whether his vvife had not fallen off some height. The woodcocke wonders at the Physitians cunning con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iecture, and turning to him againe, saith; <hi>Master, i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap> you can tell mee where she fell, I will euer esteeme you for the best Physitian in all the Countrey.</hi> The Physitian perceiuing the exceeding blockishnesse of this Clowne, and withall cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to mind the manner of their country cottages, did coniecture that his wife was fallen off some beame or lad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. <hi>The Asse sweares a great oath, and (saith he) if you can tell me how many rounds high she is fallen, I will thinke you a craftsmaster indeed, and will extoll you aboue all others.</hi> At this the Physitian had much adoe to forbeare laughter, yet biting all in, he began to consider with himselfe that the roomes in such houses are not very high, it may be (quoth he) she fell twelue rounds high. The Clowne bids him looke againe on the water, for sure there must needs bee some more. The Physitian looking downe towards the ground, bethought himselfe of some new stratagem; then with a stayed countenance turning to the Clowne, saith thus; <hi>The way is very slippery by reason of the great frost, hast thou not fallen by the way and spilt some part of the vrine vpon the ground? I fell indeed (quoth the fellow) and spilt part of it by the way.</hi> The Physitian hauing fished this out of him, with a graue and awfull countenance answereth him thus: <hi>My friend, looke for the rest of the rounds of the ladder in the place where thou spilt thy vrine, for I can find no more then I told thee.</hi> This simple sot did admire and wonder at this Physitian, as some great <hi>Prophet,</hi> and was rauished with an admiration of his extraordinary skill and experience, and giuing him exceeding great thankes for his paines, retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning home to his cottage with some few remedies, did at length, and that not without great wonder and admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:2594:57"/> relate and tell the whole circumstance of the matter as it fell out, among his fellowes and companions.</p>
                     <p>This sort of people is so full of blockish stupidity, that they will require to know by the <hi>vrine,</hi> not onely such things as we haue lately mentioned, but will moreouer be inquisitiue to know thereby whether the <hi>vrine</hi> which they carry be a Citizens or Strangers, as also where the party dwelleth: concerning the which I can tell yet as pretty a story as the former.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">History.</note>There dwelt once at <hi>Bruxels</hi> a certaine <hi>Physitian</hi> of no small account and fame for his supposed <hi>vromanticall skill:</hi> to the which <hi>Physitian</hi> at a certaine time a country-woman carrying her husbands <hi>vrine,</hi> goes in by the way to a Gentlewoman, whose tenant the country-fellow her hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band was. This Gentlewoman seeing now so fit an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity <hi>(which she had hitherto expected)</hi> offered her to deceiue this <hi>Physitian,</hi> desired this country-woman, that she might carry the <hi>vrine</hi> her selfe to him. The woman yeelding, she did as she desired. The <hi>Physitian</hi> narrowly marking the pot wherein the <hi>vrine</hi> was brought to him, and withall obseruing that it was stopt with a certaine hearbe which he knew grew no where but in one place, looking stedfastly on the Gentlewoman, whom he knew to be full of craft, did suspect some cozenage; wherefore studying to preuent the same, when the <hi>vrine</hi> was powred forth into the <hi>vrinall,</hi> with mature deliberation hee said thus; <hi>This is neither the vrine of a Gentleman or Townesman, but rather of some country Farmer, and further it was brought in at such a Gate.</hi> The Gentlewoman hearing this speech was not a little amazed, and of her owne free accord did lay open to him the poore Farmers case, and could not wonder enough at the <hi>Physitians</hi> skill and iudgement: for this foolish woman did certainly perswade her selfe that he had found out all this by the <hi>vrine</hi> onely.</p>

And thus doth the <hi>Lizzard</hi> being deadly wounded by the venemous <hi>Ʋiper,</hi> recouer the former strength againe, by eating of a certaine hearbe called a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the <hi>Italians Graliga,</hi> or <hi>Gralega,</hi> the which was

And finally is added, that Remedies are not to be prescri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed in the vulgar tongue, and that by reason of the manifold errors and abuses which doe hence arise: and so at length is concluded, that the inspection of vrines (especially as it is now adayes for the most part practised) is very deceitfull and vncertaine, neuer able to reueale and lay open vnto vs, the whole nature and circumstances of the disease.</p>

And if at any time they shall happen to meet with some folkes <hi>more nice then wise,</hi> who will not accordingly answere their demands, they will bee the more sparing in prescribing them any remedies, vntill such time as they be better acquainted with the state and nature of the disease. The most of them also and the honestest would willingly that this so wicked and peruerse custome were quite abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished, to the end they might more readily and assuredly proceed in their cures.

No lesse praise-worthy is such a City or Common-wealth, which doth maintaine at their owne cost and charges some Physitians, to the end they may in time of need more easily be helpfull to the poore, sicke, and diseased people.</p>
                     <p>But it may bee yet further demanded, what if none of the former can bee performed, the disease perhaps being so hot and acute, that neither will it admit transpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation to the place of the Physitians abode, neither yet is it safe to delay the matter any longer?<note place="margin">When and with what caueat the vrine may be sent to the Physitian.</note> In such a case I confesse, if no better may be, the <hi>vrine</hi> may be sent to the Physitian, prouiding it be sent by a discreet messenger▪ de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring by him the whole circumstances of the disease, both the beginning and encreasing, together with the time of the continuance, and all the accidents thereof, and then it might bee perhaps to some purpose. And thus might the Physitian rather vse some remedy then none at all: Howbeit yet, as we haue said, it were much better
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:2594:66"/> we did see the patient himselfe, and then to consider both of his <hi>vrine</hi> and all other circumstances of the disease.</p>
                     <p>The vncertainty of this coniecturing by <hi>vrine</hi> hath beene often obserued, not by my selfe alone, but by many other honest Physitians also, so that when as I had well viewed the <hi>vrine,</hi> as also afterwards appointed such reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies as in my iudgement were then fitting for the disease: that being immediatly after called to some of the same pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients, I haue found the same remedies to be quite contrary to the disease, and haue beene hereupon forced to alter and change againe the said formes of remedies; and this I dare sweare, that a number of other Physitians are of the same opinion with me, if they beare any loue to the truth.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">The foolish cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome of some people to try the Physitians skill by the vrine.</note>Some are also of this foolish and idle humour, that they will come with their <hi>water</hi> to the Physitian, and that onely to heare what he will say concerning the same, not demanding any remedy for their disease: now this is the highest degree of folly; for what is this else, but as if one should say, I would willingly know my disease, and yet it is not my purpose to part from it; euen as if a man which hath receiued some dangerous wound, would shew the same to the Surgeon, and yet would not haue it cured. But let such people beware, lest thus dallying with their dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eases, the time and opportunity of doing themselues good passe not away.</p>
                     <p>It may be yet perhaps demanded, but what if one be amisse, yet not so extreamly sicke, but that yet he is able to trauell abroad; In such a case, I say, may not such a one carry his <hi>vrine</hi> to the Physitians? I doe not deny it, if hee obserue such cautions as are in this case to bee obserued, and that withall he acquaint the Physitian with the whole circumstances of his disease. And how I pray thee can the Physitian giue thee sound and good counsaile for thy disease, vnlesse he vnderstand throughly the originall and ground of it, together with all that concerneth it; for bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it is to deny thy helpe to the sicke, then by thy teme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and rashnesse to precipitate him into extreame dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:2594:66"/> or yet (as <hi>Empirickes, women-physitians,</hi> and such like) to cure him casually and by meere chance and hazard.

For, this we doe onely out of that feruent affection wee beare to our neighbour whom wee see so to be gulled.</p>
                     <p>Is it not fit to cleanse the Wheate from the Tares?<note place="margin">Errors ought to be reproued &amp; banished out of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth.</note> Is it vnseemly to defend and maintaine honest and simple peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple from the impostures of cozeners and deceiuers? When the Iudge punisheth offenders, is it not to maintaine ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest men in their right, and that not for any grudge or ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice he beareth to the party, but to defend the innocent, the widow and orphanes from oppression. The Father in like sort chastiseth his sonne, to reclaime him from his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orderly courses, and that when he commeth to yeares of discretion he may liue an honest man: wherefore while as wee see that errors and abuses haue crept in into this noble Profession, shall wee not be thought to haue betrayed our profession, and with it mens liues, if wee giue no warning of the same? Is it not our parts, when we see a stumbling blocke, or a stone, laid in our blinde neighbours way, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moue, or at least to doe our best to remoue them out of his way.</p>
                     <p>As for our selues, if all things were well weighed, it may be,<note place="margin">Great gaine commeth often to good Physi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians by the er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours of <hi>Empi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricks</hi> &amp; others.</note> our gaine would not proue so great as thou ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginest, in regard there commeth often to vs no small profit by the errors of <hi>Empirickes,</hi> and such like scumme and off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scowrings.

<pb n="92" facs="tcp:2594:68"/> them which haue at the first beene preposterously cured by those abusers, then by them to whom I was my selfe at first called. This will many moe besides my selfe, I thinke, confesse. Now if we had beene called to them at first, then might they haue beene more speedily, with lesse danger, and paine to their purses, cured at first.</p>
                     <p>And wheras it may be obiected, that some of our learned, iudicious, and as they call them, dogmaticall <hi>Physitians,</hi> do still vse this coniecturing by <hi>vrine</hi> after the manner wee haue declared, prescribing likewise some Remedies, which if they help not the Patient; yet doe they doe him no hurt, and that onely lest they should seeme to doe nothing: such I say doe in this as absurdly as the Mariner, who in the greatest storme and tempest committeth his ship to the discretion of the boysterous windes and raging waues of the Sea. Neyther ought the <hi>Physitian</hi> to entertaine this base and beggarly custome, fearing lest if they goe from him, they should carry the same to some <hi>Empiricke:</hi> but this should rather be a motiue to make them warne the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients to beware of being bewitched with this so dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and tyrannicall a custome.</p>
                     <p>It is the part of the Patient to send for the Physitian, who shall then best be able to obserue his disease, with all the signes and circumstances thereof: Now if any will come to vs, and not lay open their disease, it were better to send such Asses home without any counsell; for sending Physicke to parties whose diseases thou knowest not, thou maist be a meanes of furthering them to their end, being vnprepared, and so likewise endanger their soules.</p>
                     <p>But admit the Physitian be present, yet is it not suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent that he play his part, but likewise the sicke, and such as assist, and minister vnto him, as also other outward things, which might much hinder the cure, as our renowned <hi>Hippocrates</hi> doth teach vs,<note place="margin">Hipp. aph. <hi>1.</hi> lib. <hi>1</hi>

The <hi>vrine</hi> was thin and cleere, with a small residence, (for the <hi>Fluxe</hi> of blood had ceased but a little before) of a golden colour, inclining somewhat to Saffron, insomuch that neither could any haue discerned any inflamation, nor acute <hi>Feuer</hi> by the same; howbeit it was somwhat coloured: but vnderstanding by the seruant that his stones were exceeding swollen (the which no man by the <hi>vrine</hi> could euer haue discerned) I went to him my selfe, and found that his priuy members and stones were so exceedingly swollen, that scarce had I at any time knowne the like; and at length the <hi>vrine</hi> was quite stopt, that not so much as one drop could come forth.

                     <p>Now as neither the signes nor causes of diseases can be discerned by the <hi>vrine,</hi> it followeth now in order that the indications of curing, or that part of <hi>Physicke</hi> called <hi>Thera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peutica,</hi> can no more be found out by the <hi>vrine,</hi> but it is to be found out by certaine scopes or ends, from whence are afterwards deriued certaine indications of curing. But to the end wee may more easily attaine to our purpose, wee will first of all declare what is meant by these foure, <hi>Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catio, coindicatio, contra indicatio, correpugnatio,</hi> beginning first to tell what is meant by this word <hi>Scope.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">A Scope what it is.</note> A <hi>Scope</hi> then is the tearme, or end whereunto the action is directed. <hi>Indication</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Indication.</note> is the reason or Motiue of doing such a thing, which looking vpon the <hi>Scope,</hi> doth point out to vs: or thus, <hi>Indication</hi> is the knowledge of that which may either help or hurt: <hi>Coindication</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Coindication.</note> is that which sheweth vs the same that the <hi>Indication,</hi> but not primarily of it selfe, but by accident, and as it were in another place. Thus the strength of the patient is said to indicate <hi>Phlebotomy,</hi> or a proper diet, but the temperature of the body, the age, the
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:2594:76"/> sexe, the custome do coindicate the same, because they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare in what state the strength of the body standeth, and consequently doe declare and point out the dyet, not of themselues, but by others mediation and comming betwixt them. <hi>Contraindication</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Contraindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> is that which primarily and princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally doth hinder that which was suggested by the indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant: as the abundance of humours do indicate a plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full euacuation; the <hi>Contraindicant</hi> is the want of vigour and strength, hindering this worke, and opposing the selfe against it, as being more by the same ouerthrowen then any thing else within the body of man according to the course of nature. <hi>Correpugnation</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Correpugna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> (if so I may say) or <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>repugnantia,</hi> are such things as doe secondarily oppose themselues to the <hi>Indication,</hi> and as one might say oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing themselues together, or ioyning with the other in opposition, such as are in euacuation, the age, the sexe, the temperature of the body, and the rest of this nature and kinde: all which when they shew the imbecillitie and weakenesse of naturall strength, doe either not admit any euacuation at all, or else do insinuate the apt and due mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of the same.

                        <seg rend="decorInit">N</seg>Ow then to acquit my selfe of my former promise, and to the end this matter may more manifestly appeare, I will out of the former famous Physitians briefly set down the chiefe scopes from whence the indica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of curing are taken.<note place="margin">1 <hi>Scope.</hi> Whether wee are to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take the Cure or no.</note> The first <hi>scope</hi> of all therefore shall be, <hi>whether that wee would take in hand ought to be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken;</hi> for if it be possible, then may wee boldly goe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it; if impossible, then not to attempt it. Now to the end the <hi>Physitian</hi> may vndertake or not vndertake a cure, two things are to be considered, the <hi>efficient,</hi> and the <hi>mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> or <hi>instrument</hi> on the which the <hi>Physitian</hi> is to worke. Then come wee next to the <hi>manner of curing.</hi> Now then if wee meane to proceed in it, two things must concurre, <hi>the power,</hi> and <hi>the matter;</hi> if either bee wanting wee can doe nothing to any purpose; as if any member of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy be <hi>deficient, eye, nose, &amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>Physitian</hi> himselfe may in like manner be <hi>deficient,</hi> in regard of his ignorance and insufficiencie, such as be <hi>Empiricks, women-physitians, &amp;c.</hi> who are fitter for baser imployments then for so weighty a calling. The skilfull and learned <hi>Physitian</hi> may yet be deficient also in regard of some operations set downe by some famous auncient <hi>Physitians,</hi> as being in those dayes vsuall, now disused and discontinued; as for example, the incision of the diseased of a <hi>Dropsy,</hi> the which perhaps may be either in regard of the difficultie thereof, or in regard of the decaying of the strength, it not beeing then safe to administer the same. Sometimes also it commeth to passe that although as well the <hi>matter</hi> as the <hi>instrument</hi> be fitted for the operation, that
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:2594:77"/> yet notwithstanding it is not safe to goe about the cure, in consideration of some other circumstances which doe internally or externally happen and befall the subiect wee are to deale withall. The <hi>internall may bee the temperature of the body, perturbations of the mind, age, and sometimes the self-wilfulnesse of the sicke.</hi> For if we should appoint a strict and thin sparing dyet, the temperature of the body not beeing able to beare the same (as commonly wee see in cholericke bodyes) then may it rather doe harme &amp;c. So must wee be sparing with <hi>Phlebotomy</hi> either in yong chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, or yet in women with child, especially towards the beginning and later end of their time, the like circumspe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction is to be vsed in purging remedies. Neither yet are wee to neglect the <hi>perturbations of the mind,</hi> as in faint har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted people wee are to vse these remedies sparingly, as also in <hi>Laskes,</hi> and in the <hi>menstruous flux of women,</hi> and in the <hi>Piles</hi> or <hi>Hemorrhoids.</hi> Such things as doe externally befall vs, are first the ayre, and therefore in soft and foggy bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, in any great excesse of Summers heat or Winters cold the same ought to bee restrained if not wholly inhibited: the like being vnderstood of an exceeding hot or cold re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. Custome also must not be contemned, for some ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>customing themselues to feed 3. or 4. times a day, falling sicke must be more liberally dyeted; and such as are accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomed to purging and bleeding, sustaine lesse hurt by the same. In like sort we are to consider whether we are to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt any thing at all, or to commit the whole worke to natures wise disposing, according to the opinion of <hi>Argen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terius:</hi> or yet if we see the disease so farre gone that there is no good to be done, not to attempt to do any thing, but to foretell the dangerous issue of the same.<note place="margin">Second <hi>scope</hi> choyce of that which is fittest to be done.</note> The second <hi>scope</hi> followeth vpon the first, for hauing in the first place consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered whether we are to go in hand with the cure or no, in the next place we are to consider what is to be done, for being many things to bee done, it is not a thing of small moment to vnderstand what he is to doe, whether to vse <hi>euacuation</hi> or <hi>repletion, digestion, nutrition, alteration, refrige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,</hi>

The cause then doth indicate and declare vnto vs <hi>what wee are to doe,</hi> (as <hi>Montanus well obserueth) but the efficient cause</hi> doth especially indicate preseruation from future infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties: the <hi>materiall cause</hi> being <hi>corporeall</hi> or <hi>incorporeall,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth properly to the curing or curer of the said infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. Now these two sorts of <hi>materiall causes</hi> doe differ, the <hi>materiall corporeall cause</hi> ascribing vnto it selfe <hi>euacuation;</hi> the other being <hi>incorporeall</hi> only <hi>alteration.</hi> Or yet this <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication</hi> (according to the opinion of <hi>Argenterius</hi>) is taken from the number and difference of the infirmities, &amp;c. <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len</hi> defumeth the same from the <hi>dignity of the part or mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, the nature of the action, from the substance and scituation thereof,</hi> whom other Writers do also imitate.

Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natus</hi> in like manner draweth the first indication from the <hi>temperature of the part it selfe,</hi> affirming that the substance together with the infirmity it selfe doe both demonstrate this, (as 5. <hi>Meth</hi>

Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, <hi>Donatus</hi> taketh his indication after <hi>Galens</hi> minde, from the <hi>action,</hi> and therefore willeth vs to purgc the <hi>liuer,</hi> and <hi>stomacke</hi> with great caution and circumspection, by reason of the noblenesse of their actions, and the necessary vse of them to the whole body: thirdly, from the <hi>shape and figure of the part affected.</hi> By this meanes are we warned by which way and passage we are to euacuate, to wit, the <hi>sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macke</hi> by <hi>vomit</hi> and <hi>stoole,</hi> the <hi>guts</hi> by <hi>stoole</hi> only, as also the hollow parts of the <hi>liuer,</hi> the <hi>kidneyes,</hi> the <hi>backe-part of the
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:2594:78"/> liuer, and the bladder by the passages of the vrine, &amp;c.</hi> The fourth indication he takes from the <hi>scituation of the part.</hi> Thus are wee to apply to outward distempers remedies iust of the same degree of contrary qualities, and such as the distemper requireth. But againe the inward and farre remote parts of the body being distempered require reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies a great deale stronger then the distemper in its owne nature, and that in regard of the remotenesse of the part, the <hi>Physicke</hi> losing some of the force in the passage, &amp;c. The fift indication he taketh from the <hi>sensiblenesse</hi> of the part, such as be of an obtuse and dull feeling contemning for the most part the most effectuall meanes, although they were of a corroding and eating quality. Such parts againe as be very sensible their strength is quickly ouerthrowne. It is very meete and expedient therefore to remedy the same not all at once in one instant with strong and forci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble meanes, but for the more safety by degrees: but where the feeling is duller thou maist safely vse such remedies as thou shalt finde fitting all at one time. And thus it now appeareth plainly that this second <hi>scope</hi> is not to bee taken from the viewing of the <hi>water,</hi> as these ignorant <hi>Ʋrine-mongers</hi> doe most falsly suppose, who vpon the bare inspe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of it appoint their most dangerous and strong medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines, yea rather most deadly Poysons, as doe in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner our <hi>Alchymists</hi> with their most dangerous <hi>metall-medicines,</hi> they being both alike ignorant in the Principles and rules of Art. The <hi>third scope is by what meanes</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Third <hi>scope</hi> by what meanes.</note>
                        <hi>wee ought to bring that to passe which we intend.</hi> This scope then requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth the furniture of such stuffe as <hi>Physicke</hi> is able to afford vs, the which either the disease or the cause of the same doth indicate. If the disease, then it cannot be sufficiently knowne without the <hi>Physitians</hi> presence, much lesse cured vnlesse he be either alwaies present, or at least doe often vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site his Patient. This <hi>scope then is indicated from the disease, the cause, together with the accidents of the same.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore old inueterate obstructions doe indicate strong and forcible medicines for the opening of them: the abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:2594:79"/> of humors, such <hi>Physicke</hi> as may be fit for the euacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of the same. The disease which yet is crude admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth no euacuation before the concoction thereof. They are not therefore without blame who presently vpon the sight of the <hi>vrine</hi> onely, appoint the Patient strong and violent Purgations, whether there bee concoctions or none at all, and that quite contrary to the minde of <hi>Hippo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates</hi> and other learned <hi>Physitians.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And thus doth euery one of these indicate the owne proper remedy, whether the cause, disease, or accidents of them. <hi>Distemper</hi> doth indicate <hi>alteration; the multitude of humours euacuation; crudity, concoction; paine, mitigation of the same; any violent Fluxe, astringent and binding reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, &amp;c.</hi> The <hi>fourth scope</hi> considereth the <hi>quality of the matter,</hi> that is, <hi>a choyce of the fittest meanes,</hi> especially when they are many, together with the quantity of the same.<note place="margin">The fourth <hi>scope</hi> the selecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and choyce of the fittest meanes, and the quality of the same.</note> And therefore it is not sufficient for vs to know what doth euacuate <hi>choler</hi> or any other humour, but what effecteth it to best purpose, The quality of the remedy is taken accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to <hi>Galen,</hi> from the <hi>action</hi> which it bringeth forth, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the name from the part to the which it is appropri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate, and the infirmity which it helpeth. The first qualities such as are <hi>heat, cold, drought and moysture,</hi> are the Authors of the <hi>action,</hi> and such as are deriued from them, as those which do <hi>soften, harden, loosen, extend</hi> or <hi>stretch;</hi> and such likewise as doe follow the <hi>solidity of the substance,</hi> to wit, those that doe <hi>attenuate, that doe cut, and such as doe thicken and stuffe vp the passages,</hi> and are called properly <hi>enplasticae,</hi> as in like sort such as are engendred of the two former sorts of qualities, as are <hi>astringent, repelling, digesting, opening, thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, clensing,</hi> together with others of the same nature and kinde. Secondly, the quality of remedies is taken accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to <hi>Galen,</hi> from the <hi>similitude or likenesse of the whole substance,</hi> from whence doth proceed the purging quality, which doth draw the humours of the body, some purging one humour some another. Thirdly, it is taken from the <hi>infirmity and the part affected;</hi> as for example, <hi>Bechica</hi> bee
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:2594:79"/> such remedies as are appropriate for the <hi>cough; Stomachica, hepatica,</hi> such as befit the <hi>stomacke</hi> and <hi>liuer.</hi> Now the <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmity</hi> it selfe doth indicate the applications of the first qualities, thus; the <hi>heat</hi> that which is <hi>cold,</hi> and the <hi>cold</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine that which is <hi>hot, &amp;c.</hi> The <hi>temperature</hi> againe doth indicate the application of the like, as a <hi>cold temperature</hi> requireth a <hi>cold quality, &amp;c.</hi> The same may bee said of all the aforesaid qualities.</p>
                     <p>Now which of the qualities, that take their names from the place and the infirmity of the same, ought to be apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed vnto it, is indicated or declared as well by the nature of the part it selfe, as of the disease also. And for this cause the <hi>stomacke</hi> &amp; <hi>liuer</hi> do require such medicines as may streng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then them, as <hi>wormewood, &amp;c.</hi> Each part also doth craue her proper and peculiar remedy: and so also are some dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eases thought to be helped by some peculiar remedies; as the <hi>falling sicknesse</hi> by <hi>Peonie, &amp;c. The fift generall scope is the quantity of the remedie:</hi>
                        <note place="margin">The fift <hi>scope</hi> the quantity of the remedy.</note> and in nothing whatsoeuer doe <hi>Empiricks</hi> and ignorant <hi>Physitians</hi> erre more then in this poynt, it being notwithstanding so dangerous. It is not then sufficient to know that the disease is to bee cured by contraries; but the exact quantity of the remedy is also to be found out: for if we shall happen to ouer-coole a hot disease, we may cast the sicke into a cold disease, the which to preuent we ought to be acquainted both with the state of the body of the sicke, the disease it selfe, together with the nature and faculties of the remedies. Now that I insist not vpon the opinions of <hi>Montanus Argenterius,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, I will shew onely from whence <hi>Galen</hi> taketh his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dications of the <hi>quantity of the remedies,</hi> whom <hi>Akakia</hi> also (my sometimes kind and louing friend, when as I practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed <hi>Physicke</hi> in <hi>France</hi>) doth imitate. Hee taketh his indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the <hi>quantity;</hi> first from the greatnesse of the <hi>infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity,</hi> vnder which name I comprehend both the <hi>disease,</hi> the <hi>cause, and accidents of the same.</hi> A great infirmity ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore doth not only require a great quantity of the remedy, but also a competent power and force in the same: the
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:2594:80"/> smaller infirmity, smaller in quantity, and remisser in force: and finally the excesse of nature is to bee driuen away by the like excesse of the remedy. In the next place <hi>Galen</hi> ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth his indications from the obstinacie and stubbornnes of the disease; for when the same may easily bee remoued, then are we to exhibite our remedies seldomer and more sparingly: but if they be hard and vneasie to be remoued, then may we more freely, more copiously, and oftner ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibite our remedies. Thirdly, from the <hi>strength,</hi> for if it decay and wast, then must we exhibite our remedies spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringly and seldome: but if the case bee otherwise, then may wee oftner and frequently vse the same. Fourthly, from the proper and peculiar nature of the Patient: for ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as they differ, so must the remedies in like manner vary. Some constitutions there are to whom any <hi>Physicke</hi> will presently turne into nourishment, and such may take the same more liberally. Others there are againe who are annoyed with any <hi>Physicke</hi> whatsoeuer, so that oftentimes the very smell of it will incite them to casting; and to such thou oughtest to giue the same more sparingly. Fiftly, from the nature and condition of the part: &amp; this doth compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend also vnder it the exquisite sense and feeling, together with the dulnesse thereof, the solidity, the office, &amp;c. And therefore an acute sense and feeling doth reiect a strong and copious medicine, which a more obtuse and dull sense admitteth willingly. Likewise a thin and spongious part requireth much milder then that which is thick, hard and compact. So in like manner the <hi>noble parts,</hi> and such as performe a common duty to the whole body, (such as are the <hi>stomacke, liuer, heart,</hi> and <hi>braine</hi>) require the same more mild, and withall sparingly. On the contrary such as be obscure, ignoble, and performe no such publike and common office, may easily indure it somewhat quicker and in greater quantity. Sixtly, <hi>Galen</hi> taketh the indicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the quantity of the remedy from the shape or fashion of the part. And therefore such parts as haue within and without large and wide passages, through the which the
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:2594:80"/> medicine may be easily conueyed to the place affected, and the matter of the disease digested, require the same more gentle and more sparing: but such againe as are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitute of the same, or haue their passages narrower, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire it both more copious and more quicke. Seauenthly, from the <hi>situation</hi> and connexion of the part with others; for such as bee outward hauing any society with the <hi>sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macke</hi> and <hi>guts,</hi> require the same both gentle and little in quantity: but such as bee more remote from the former, demand it in greater abundance and stronger withall.</p>

And therefore it is not without cause that <hi>Montanus</hi> saith, wee are well to consider how and after what manner we go about that we take in hand: for we proceed after one manner when it is a maligne dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease, and otherwise when it is secure and void of danger: as also many dangerous accidents require a course farre differing from that disease where there is no such thing to be seene. Now the materiall cause also, or the subiect in the which the disease is inherent doth indicate the same, as that the cure must proceed after one manner in the <hi>braine,</hi> &amp; after another in the <hi>liuer.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Vale Gal. ad Glam. Monta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num.</note> And to the former may be also added the <hi>sicke parties custome, state of life or calling, the time of the yeare, age, temperature, or constitution of body; the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the disease, or the resting or staying of the same, and the nature of the place affected.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>A number of other indications for breuities sake I of purpose passe by, howbeit these may sufficiently declare vnto vs that which the stinking <hi>vrine</hi> will neuer doe. Now notwithstanding all the premises, we shall yet remaine in great doubt and suspence, vnlesse things bee done conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niently and in due time. And therefore the <hi>seauenth scope considereth the due &amp; conuenient time</hi>
                        <note place="margin">The seuenth <hi>scope.</hi> The fit &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient time.</note>
                        <hi>for that we take in hand.</hi> Thus the motion of the disease doth indicate when to doe or not to doe, and the time likewise of the disease. And therfore if the motion of the disease be quick &amp; speedy, we
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:2594:81"/> must with all speed helpe and succour the same: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we must helpe very acute and sharpe diseases on the very selfe same day they begin vpon, enioyning a most ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite and sparing dyet withall, <hi>delay being here most dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous.</hi> If the disease goe on slowly, the matter of the same not swelling, nor yet in very great abundance, but still and quiet, then are wee to expect the concoction of the same. The time of the disease doth indicate that we ought not to attempt any euacuation at the beginning, but in the increase, when as the signes of concoction do manifestly appeare. In the beginning of <hi>inflamations</hi> we are to abstaine from such medicines as doe digest and discusse. In the increase, and when it is now come to a stand and stay, we are to vse the same. So according to the minde of <hi>Galen</hi> the fit and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient time is taken from the times of the disease, the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence of the <hi>accidents,</hi> and from the <hi>concoctions.</hi> So like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise the sicke parties proper and peculiar disposition, as also the remedies which haue gone before or ought to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, as also the preceding or following infirmities, do of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten further or hinder the exhibiting of any more <hi>Physicke.</hi> And for this cause if the nature of the infirmity require <hi>Phlebotomy,</hi> and yet the selfe same day the sicke haue taken a purging potion, we must of necessity deferre the remedy howbeit in it selfe very necessary. Now such things as doe commonly indicate, are the <hi>infirmities</hi> themselues, together with the state and <hi>condition of the body.</hi> Such things againe as doe hinder, are sometimes the <hi>disorder and vnrulinesse of the sicke, the frowardnesse of the Physitian, the perturbations of the minde, as also the manners and disposition of the sicke.</hi> The particular occasion hath in like manner the own pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and peculiar indications: but such as in regard they are conuersant about particulars, are rather to be learned by experience then by reason.</p>
                     <p>Now these seuen foresaid <hi>scopes</hi> being common to other actions, we will yet adde two more, to wit, the <hi>eighth</hi> and <hi>ninth,</hi> concerning the <hi>place</hi> and <hi>order,</hi> the which are more peculiarly appropriated to this Profession. The eighth
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:2594:81"/>
                        <hi>scope</hi> teacheth vs to apply our remedies to the <hi>proper place.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">The eight <hi>scope</hi> The proper place.</note> And therefore the <hi>great guts</hi> demand <hi>glisters,</hi> as fit reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies; the <hi>small guts, some purge taken at the mouth;</hi> the <hi>sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macke</hi> or <hi>maw, a vomit, and sometimes a purge; the backe-parts of the liuer, by such means as prouoke vrine,</hi> as hath been said already, and so in many others, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>But as in other the former <hi>scopes,</hi> so in this also, some things do sometimes occurre, which doe often hinder that wee cannot hansomely bring to passe that which is by the indications suggested vnto vs. As for example, the mouth of the <hi>stomacke</hi> being much perplexed by reason of hot distemper, and demaunding some actually cooling reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to bee applyed thereunto, the <hi>scituation of the midriffe</hi> doth prohibite vs from applying any such outward reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. The ninth <hi>scope</hi> is the order.<note place="margin">The ninth <hi>scope.</hi> The order.</note> For when as in a disease there be diuers things to be done, it concerneth vs not a little to know what is to be done in the first place, what in the second, and so consequently in order. Thus are we for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced sometimes in burning <hi>feuers,</hi> first of all to coole the whole body, then next we remoue the obstructions. As also when the strength of the body is almost quite wasted away, and the spirits neere spent, before we either set vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the disease or the cause thereof, wee are constrained to administer some such comfortable nourishment and other meanes as may best nourish and comfort feeble &amp; distres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed nature. In like manner we doe first clense a distempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vlcer from the matter and corruption of it, before wee attempt to cure the distemper of the same. And therefore I thinke this <hi>axiome</hi> worthy the remembring, which may also direct vs what to doe, to wit,<note place="margin">Vide Argent. lib. <hi>2.</hi> de offic. Medici. cap. <hi>18.</hi> Donat. <hi>1.</hi> part. de febr. Heurn. Meth. ad praxin. lib. <hi>3.</hi> &amp;c.</note>
                        <hi>that wee are to begin with that which most presseth and vrgeth vs,</hi> to wit, that first of all we remoue the same, and in the next place that which sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyeth the place of the efficient cause: Lastly, wee are to come to such things, without the which the rest cannot be accomplished. But of these things thou maist at great length see the learned volumes of diuers famous <hi>Physi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians.</hi>

                     <p>And now I hope it is apparant to the eyes of euery one, that such <hi>Physitians</hi> proue fooles who doe from the inspe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the <hi>vrine,</hi> affirme that they are able to finde out any one, much lesse all these foresaid <hi>scopes,</hi> which is as impossible, as if they would containe all the water of the Sea in a few spoones. Whence it commeth to passe that these <hi>water-prophets</hi> plunge themselues in a world of er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, if omitting and passing by these <hi>scopes</hi> and indicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons vpon the bare sight of the <hi>vrine</hi> they shall happen to prescribe <hi>Physicke</hi> for their Patients: when as these for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer indications do more then sufficiently declare, that the presence of the <hi>Physitian</hi> is also required to assist his Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent. And some are not content rashly and boldly vpon the bare sight of the <hi>vrine,</hi> (as is said) to prescribe their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies, but doe withall, publishing the same in their vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar tongue to the great damage of many, prostitute the same to euery ones idle braine and fancie, to abuse them at his pleasure. But of this wee will now speake at greater length in this next Chapter.</p>

And this is the <hi>prescription of remedies in the vulgar tongue.</hi> And therefore the renowned <hi>Hippocrates</hi> leaueth vs this instruction, that <hi>high and great mysteries are not to be communicated to the ignorant multitude, but onely to such as are initiate &amp; trained vp in the grounds &amp; principles of the same.</hi> And it doth manifestly appeare, that if the myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:2594:82"/> and secrets of nature be laid open to wicked people, to Impostors and deceiuers, or yet to the vnlearned, they doe exceedingly abuse the same. And therefore the foresaid <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> vpon the admission of such as he found wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to enter into this profession; tyed them to the oath of obseruing such precepts &amp; ordinances as are set downe in that <hi>science,</hi> most prouidently foreseeing what great cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity and vnexpected mischiefe might befall men, if the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets and mysteries of this Art were made common to knaues and ignorant people. But this cursed custome is growne so common, that the vulgar sort of people seeme to haue this noble Art of <hi>Physicke</hi> to sell and dispose of at their pleasures.<note place="margin">This disorder occasioned by the sordid co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uetousnes of the patient.</note> Now this commeth to passe in part by means of the sordid and base niggardlinesse of many, who either do obtaine through importunity or otherwise, the prescription of their remedies in the vulgar tongue, to the end they may againe if need so require, vse the same in the like case, or yet communicate the same to their friends or acquaintance; and sometimes also after the seruing of their bill, get the same againe from the Apothecary to serue for the same purpose, not considering with themselues the manifold alterations and changes which may fall out in a short time, insomuch that that which before proued to be a most soueraigne remedy for thy health, may now by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of some circumstances, be the cause of thy vtter ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw and ruine. And thus haue I sometimes seene the billes of a <hi>Physitian</hi> dead twelue yeares before, carried to the Apothecaries shop to be made againe. And moreouer now of late I met with a bill wherein was set downe the description of a purging Potion, being communicated from house to house, and so sent to the Apothecaries shop to be prepared, and was indifferently exhibited to euery one which demanded it, and that without any regard ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of age, sexe, temperature of body, or season of the yeare, &amp;c. Againe in the next place,<note place="margin">As also by meanes of the Apothecary.</note> this commeth also to passe, by reason of the couetousnesse and auarice of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pothecary, who is ready (ayming onely at his owne gaine
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:2594:83"/> and profit) at all times, and to all sorts of persons, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare and make ready such billes as are prescribed either in the <hi>Latine,</hi> or yet in the vulgar tongue: the which neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thelesse ought not to be done, vnlesse the <hi>Physitian</hi> out of his discretion, shall thinke it fit for that indiuiduall party.

                     <p>And this was the song of that sordid Emperour <hi>Ʋespasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, The smell of gaine is alwayes good from whence soeuer it doth come, &amp;c.</hi> Now howbeit at my first comming out of <hi>Italy,</hi> finding this peruerse custome to haue crept in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst my Countreymen, and therefore at first I also, howbeit against my will, gaue way for a season to this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueterate custome; yet after a while well weighing with my selfe the manifold abuses and inconueniences of this so per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerse a custome, I began to shake this burthen off my shoulders, refusing to write any billes at all either in the Latine or vulgar tongue.<note place="margin">A laudable cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome of the <hi>Italian Physiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> in writing all their billes in paper-books, kept by the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pothecary.</note> And therefore I gaue the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thecary a paper-booke to keepe by him, in the which I wrote downe all my notes and receipts, as is the laudable custome of the <hi>Italian Physitians:</hi> this booke I charged him to keepe, and to suffer none to write out any receipt or note out of it; nor yet to prepare any of them without my knowledge and priuity.</p>
                     <p>But if any will yet obiect that this is for our owne pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate commodity, let him know that the honest, carefull, and conscionable <hi>Physitian</hi> doth not so gape after gaine as doe the multitude of these mercenary counterfeit <hi>Physitians,</hi> being such in name onely; but aboue all things aymeth chiefly at the health of his Patient, preferring it euen before his owne priuate gaine and commodity, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to redeeme their health, if it were with dammage and detriment to himselfe. The which what other profession I pray thee will thus put in practice. And yet ought not the Patient to be so miserable and base-minded as to bee vnthankfull to his <hi>Physitian:</hi> howbeit when he hath been
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:2594:83"/> most bountifull in this kind,<note place="margin">The Physitian can neuer bee sufficiently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compenced for his paines.</note> yet is he neuer able to requite him for so worthy a thing as is the health of the body: for whatsoeuer is giuen in this kinde is nothing else but a signe and token of a thankfull minde for so great and ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimable a benefit receiued. And this may plainly appeare if wee shall but consider the equall intercourse and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce amongst men, on the which the whole streame of <hi>Iustice</hi> and <hi>equity</hi> is founded; for then it will plainly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare, that howsoeuer money and wealth may counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poyse and match things of their owne ranke and nature; yet will it neuer bee able (as being of a farre inferiour and baser ranke and degree) condignly to recompence or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the same. And in this may the difference bee seene betwixt this noble Profession and other inferiour mecha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicall Arts, in the which it is apparant that the labourer may sufficiently be recompenced for his bodily labour and paines, as <hi>equity, long custome,</hi> or yet mutuall couenant shall agree vpon. And put yet the c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>se that health doe not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue (as it often pleaseth the Almighty otherwise to dispose) who can giue the <hi>Physitian</hi> a sufficient competent recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence for all his toyle, labour and paines;<note place="margin">Whatsoeuer is bestowed vpon the <hi>Physitian</hi> for his paines, is but a token of the Patients thankfulnesse, called properly <hi>honorarium</hi> not <hi>salarium,</hi> as in the mechani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Arts.</note> but especially for his anxiety of minde, his great solicitude and care which hee day and night vndergoeth, for the misery, calamity, and perplexed estate of his distressed Patients? Can any man of vnderstanding think that a small summe of money can sufficiently requite the same? No; if thou wert as rich as <hi>Craesus</hi> all thy wealth were not sufficient to recompence them condignly.</p>
                     <p>But to returne to our purpose againe, I hope that ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest and ingenuous <hi>Physitians</hi> will not follow this vulgar and corrupt custome: but will not onely themselues ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staine from divulgating abroad their billes or bookes in the vulgar tongue, as also from this preposterous and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerse manner of <hi>inspection of vrines</hi> in their owne Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers; but will also as much as in them lyeth, labour to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claime others from this error. And if yet they shall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps not attaine to their intended end and purpose; yet
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:2594:84"/> shall they in this poynt performe the part of honest and carefull <hi>Physitians.</hi> If any will yet further obiect, that if the <hi>vrine</hi> doe neither demonstrate and shew forth the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities nor yet the indications of the same, to what end and purpose haue you heretofore referred the inspection thereof to so necessary and profitable a part of <hi>Physicke,</hi> as that which the <hi>Physitians</hi> call commonly <hi>semeioticall,</hi> or handling the signes of diseases? To this I answer, that none of our best <hi>Physitians</hi> doe deny the necessary and lawfull vse thereof; but yet after a farre other manner then most men haue hitherto conceiued. My minde and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose therefore is not, nor euer was, to take away the right vse, but to reforme the abuse of the same, and taking away that which hath beene by it vsurped, and now for a long time vniustly detained, to make knowne to the world what of right and due belongeth to the same, as hath been at great length declared already. And thus I thinke it fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting that the <hi>Physitian</hi> bee present with his Patient there, not onely to view his <hi>vrine,</hi> but also narrowly to consider of all other such signes as do offer themselues to his view. For if wee thinke the presence of the <hi>Surgeon</hi> necessary for the curing of any outward wound receiued in the body, if hee will cure the same according to Art as he ought: much more is it requisite that the <hi>Physitian</hi> be present with his Patient, being sicke of any internall disease, to the end that both hee may consider of all such things as we haue heretofore spoken of, as also that hee may obserue and marke all such things as may further or yet hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the cure of the same, as hath beene already at great length declared and set downe. Now it may perhaps be replyed, this is not a thing like to be reformed, since it is not vnlikely that the greatest part will still retaine their old inueterate custome, and will not free themselues from imposture and cozenage. To them I answere, that I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue this to be true, all men are not of one minde, neither yet can wee alone amend all errors which are crept into this noble profession; diuers others hauing before our
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:2594:84"/> times (although not with the expected issue) attempted the like. In the meane time this shall giue the world a sufficient testimony of our diligence and care, in that wee haue here opposed our selues against some such errors, as haue somewhat darkened the bright splendour of this Profession, and for the benefit of the sicke, laboured and indeuoured to remoue out of the society of the best appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued <hi>Physitians,</hi> this vaine babbling and coniecturing by the <hi>Ʋrine:</hi> and some I hope there will be not onely ready to approue and think well of these our endeuours, but will also translate the same in their vulgar tongues, to the end that the most simple and ignorant may by this meanes, if they will, free themselues from the imposture and coze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage of these deceiuing <hi>Water-mongers.</hi> For this cause also are we to pray to the great and mighty God of heauen, that he would touch the ignorant consciences of these <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cophants, iuggling and cozening Empirickes, woman-Physitians,</hi> and all the rest of that rabble, that yet at length they may repent them of their cozenages and impostures. I doe in like manner most earnestly intreat and request all learned <hi>Physitians</hi> that they would ioyne with mee and others of my minde in these our so honest endeauours; and wee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine will not be wanting on our parts: and further if at any time by meanes of the importunity of some wee shall bee forced to giue way to this inspection of <hi>vrine</hi> in our owne Chambers, we shall neuerthelesse giue warning to euery one who shall thus come to aske counsell at our hands, that it were a great deale better that we were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted to the place where the sicke party lyeth, that so both more easily and more safely we might doe our best for the restoring of him againe to his former health. But if on the other side they will not hearken to this our whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some admonition, the fault shall lye vpon themselues.</p>
                     <p>Now at length to draw this our Discourse to an end, I hope it doth plainly appeare, that the generall conclusion whereabout we haue so much bestirred our selues in this whole Discourse, as being the maine subiect thereof, to
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:2594:85"/> wit, <hi>that the iudgement of the nature and essence of diseases by the sole inspection of the Vrine, is very full of danger and deceit,</hi> is plainely and conspicuously laid open to the view of euery one that will not shut vp his eyes that hee may not behold manifest truth. And certainly the very loue we ought to beare vnto our neighbours might bee a sufficient motiue to induce vs to lay open to the view of the world all such errors whereby our neighbour might be any wayes indangered or indammaged, to the end hee may auoid and shun the same.</p>
                     <p>Now GOD of his great goodnesse grant that this la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour and paines which I haue so willingly vnderta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for this end and purpose bee not frustrate of the due effect.</p>

The which as it is by diuers meanes occasioned, so is this impostorious coniecturing by vrines (I meane as most do vse it) none of the least. In the former discourse I aduanced the auantguard of my forces against this vsurper on another mans right: and in this I now set forward the whole forces of the maine battell, not onely to batter, but to beate downe, if it be possible, this so enormous abuse. And as the former, so was this last birth, in the very first conception, conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated to your Highnesse. As therefore it pleased your
<pb facs="tcp:2594:88"/> Highnesse with your Princely protection to grace my former labours, and kindly to accept of the same; so do I now most humbly intreate you, with a gracious aspect to countenance these my latter paines. The gift, I grant, is farre inferiour to your greatnesse; but the saying of <hi>Plinie</hi> doth somewhat comfort me, affirming that<note n="a" place="margin">Lacte dijs multae gentes supplicant &amp; mola falsa li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant.

Afterwards also were set downe diuerse scopes and indications requisite for the cure of the disease, prescription of remedies vpon the bare inspe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the vrine onely, reproued, together with diuers other things there at great length to be seene.

And of this I purposed to haue made thee partaker about a twelue moneth ago, according as the catalogue then made mention, but that some rubs haue vntill now robbed me of the effecting my purpose.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Summe and substance of this whole discourse</note>In this therefore I enter into a narrow suruey of all the seuerall parts of vrine, which for this cause I call the <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomie of vrines.</hi> Now whereas for breuitie I haue passed by the seuerall significations, and vncertaintie of some colours
<pb facs="tcp:2594:89"/> of vrines, to wit, such as do decline from any one extreame, what concerneth the same, may easily, by that which hath bene said of the same extreame, be vnderstood. Now if any shall enquire what is the cause I spend so much time about this subiect: I answer, it is by reason of the old inueterate o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, or rather errour, which most people haue conceiued concerning this strumpet; whom for this cause I haue here vnmasked, and layed open to the view of euery one that will not shut his eyes in the cleare Sunne-shine; and that to the end that none may be circumuented by the fraud and coze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage of such as abuse her for their owne benefit. But lest any should imagine these things to be but fancies fetcht from mine owne braine, therefore not contented to set down mine owne positiue opinion, I haue both backt, fortified and flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked it with the bulwarks of the best writers of ancient and later times, whose owne words I haue truly translated, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting thee likewise, learned Reader, to the marginall quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, where for thy recreation and better satisfaction, not the names of the authors onely, and the particular places, but the very words of the originall are often set downe, that so it may more euidently appeare, that this latter iurie finds her guiltie, as the former great enquest after the inditement found <hi>Billa vera.</hi> The condemnation must then of necessitie follow, since the parties offending hauing had these three last assizes allowed them to pleade for themselues, haue said no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. This sentence I referre to this<note n="*" place="margin">The hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Court of Parliament.</note> sage assembly, who, as I hope, will take this publicke businesse, as a matter of no small moment, into their serious considerations. But me thinkes I heare some say, what is then the vse of vrines in discerning of diseases? or serueth it for no vse at all? I answer, that so farre am I from abrogating this so ancient and necessarie a signe, receiued by all our ancient and late writers, which I do highly esteeme, and account of the same being rightly
<pb facs="tcp:2594:90"/> vsed, howbeit as it is commonly vsed, it is most shamefully a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bused.</p>
                  <p>The right vse of vrine<note place="margin">The right vse of vrines.</note> then is, together with all the rest of the signes and seuerall circumstances of the disease (in such diseases I meane where it is of any force or validitie, in some diseases being of no vse at all) to giue vs notice of the nature, together with the changes and alterations, as like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise what is like to be the issue of the same. The Physitian is therefore first to enquire diligently into the nature of the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease, together with all the other signes and circumstances thereof: and then, comparing all together, to giue forth his best and most assured iudgement. Most foolish therefore and absurd is the sottish custome of the countrey people<note place="margin">Foolish custom of the countrey people.</note> now a dayes, bringing the vrine to the Physitian, it may be in some old oylie or inkie bottle, and then to demand of him as of some <hi>Delphian oracle,</hi> the whole nature of the disease, the pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents age, and diuerse other things wherewith they ought to acquaint vs, as also with all the other signes and circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the disease: euen as the client is to lay open his cause to the Lawyer, how learned soeuer, and skilfull in his profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion. It is yet not vnworthie the obseruation, that one and the same vrine hath often diuers and seuerall significations, and therefore vnlesse by diuerse other signes and circumstances limited, can neuer affoord vs any certaintie, as hereafter both in the colours and contents the ensuing discourse shall make manifest. And thus may the right vse to the wise and vnderstanding easily appeare; especially to such as haue bene or yet shall hereafter be admitted vnto such mysteries. And therefore ignorant Empiricks, women, and many other such, haue no share or interest in these affaires, as not being able to diue into the depth of the premisses. And as for cleargie men, they cannot be ignorant, that they ought to be employed about businesses of an higher nature. And if they will haue a care
<pb facs="tcp:2594:90"/> of the soules entrusted to them, they need not trouble them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues with their bodies. Now that one signe, in some disea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses onely to be obserued to be of any vse, should with a Papall prerogatiue assume all authoritie vnto it selfe, is both against common sense, daily experience,<note place="margin">The pulse in many diseases to be preferred be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the vrine.</note> and the authorities of the learned. The pulse will pleade for a preheminence aboue the vrine: and to iudge of this, as of a number of other signes, it will of necessitie require the Physitians presence. Now that the vrines in many diseases, and those of vndoubted danger, do often shew thee no more then the ground thou go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est on; and that many other signes besides are of necessitie to be obserued, hath bene at great length related in the former tractate, and shall yet more plainly and particularly in this which followeth appeare. And for thy more particular infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, I haue set downe the seuerall significations of vrines, and that according to the opinions of such Authors as haue written of them; together with some particulars which haue neuer yet bene published by any English writer that I haue as yet seene, as by the contents of the bookes and chapters may appeare. Some things also which haue bene by others written and auouched for vncontrolled truths, I haue confuted as false and erronious: and that, as I thinkt, by vnanswerable arguments, illustrating the same with varietie of ancient and recent authorities, together with plentie of pertinent examples, being true historicall relations, obserued both by my selfe and other Authors: the which howsoeuer they do not simply proue; yet do they not a little illustrate the matter in hand, and make it more perspicuous to the meaner sort. Now whereas I sometimes insert something of the ignorance and vnsufficiencie of some offenders, some may, perhaps, reply, that it may sometimes befall a good Physitian to faile as well as any of them. I confesse Indeed, <hi>Bernardus non videt om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia: He is a good horse that neuer stumbled.</hi> Neuer to
<pb facs="tcp:2594:91"/> faile is a priuiledge denyed to any of the ofspring of sinfull Adam:<note place="margin">Quandoque bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus dormitat Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merus. Horat.</note> howbeit the learned Physitian building vpon rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son and experience, keepeth alwayes an orderly and metho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicall course in all his proceedings: and if he may sometimes erre (as being a man and not a God) how much more then an ignorant Empiricke, a shee-Physitian (such a one as now li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth in Northamptonshire, and in whom I wonder that any that hath any braines in his head can see any sufficiencie) that I say nothing of a medling Minister that neuer was trained vp in that profession; shall they I say be obnoxious to error in so intricate an Art, wherein they haue no interest, as being meere vsurpers vpon other mens right? Besides, the vulgar not being able to iudge of the sufficiencie of the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Physitian, preferreth often the paines of some ignorant Empiricke, (soothed vp it may be by the successe of some ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suall cure) before the labors of the most learned &amp; honest ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tist. But my meaning is here of an ordinary erronious course of practising, euē against the rules of art, &amp; the very grounds &amp; principles of this physicall profession. Of such errors I could haue set downe a multitude, besides those few which I had by relation, either from the patients themselues, or else from some of their most familiar friends and acquaintances, who haue protested, that they will be readie to iustifie the same vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon their oathes.<note place="margin">Casuall cures sometimes suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding, do not proue a suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encie in the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties thus practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing.</note> Neither yet let this suffice, that some of their proctors pleade for them a number of happy and successefull euents; since that thus we may often magnifie the most vile wizard, and most ignorant old wife in the countrey: this ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument taken from issue and euent being a meere Paralo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gisme, a fallacie and deceit, taking that often for a true cause which is no cause indeed, as in the conclusion of this discourse shall more plainly appeare. And in this I appeale to the learned and honest Artist, not to such a persons parasite, who taketh for good and current coyne what soeuer commeth
<pb facs="tcp:2594:91"/> out of his mint, nor yet their otherwise honest, yet in this point, too partiall patients, in this particular blinded with the mist of ignorance, or a preiudicate opinion of such mens supposed sufficiencie, they themselues not being able herein to discerne betwixt right and wrong.</p>
                  <p>Now that this hath bene no<note n="a" place="margin">An vsual &amp; or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarie custome to browbeat &amp; ouerthrow er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors and impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture, and to pleade for truth.</note> vnusuall custome to brow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beat and ouerthow errors, euen in this profession, and for the maintaining of truth to pleade against imposture, might ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily, as well by ancient as later authorities, be euinced, which would be too tedious here to relate.

And for the better furtherance of this his purpose, he granted many priui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges and immunities to the aforesaid Vniuersities &amp; schooles, the whole Professors and Students in the same. And thus phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicke with the rest reuiued againe; and being healed of her for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer wounds, was drawne out of the darke dungeon and prison wherin she had so long lien in thraldome and captiuitie, and by meanes of this noble Emperour restored to her former dignitie and libertie againe.

But well foreseeing the inconueniences which might from hence arise, if all such businesses should depend vpon his court; for this cause he granted this priuiledge and authoritie to the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foresaid Vniuersities throughout the whole Empire.

And remember, that there may be an ouersight as well in neglecting a fit and conuenient remedie in due time, as in exhibiting a dangerous and desperate remedie. And whereas often it cometh to passe, that either your necessitie or importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie doth extort from the learned Physitian good and whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some remedies either for your owne or others infirmities: yet I intreate you, not to be so indiscreete, as to make one salue serue for euery sore. The remedie indeed may be good, but (as often cometh to passe) ill vsed, or rather abused.<note place="margin">A good remedy ignorantly or out of season ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited, may yet proue dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eased.</note> And that which you haue sometimes tried to be a soueraigne medicine for your selues; yet another time, by reason of a number of new occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, the same remedie may produce an effect farre differing from the former: how much more then in another?

But put yet the case the remedie be good against such a disease; yet may many other circumstances crosse this iudication in any indiuiduall person, which were here too tedious to relate.

There each seuerall Citie, towne, or corporation, hath certaine Physi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians entertained by stipends out of the chamber stockes (which there by reason of their admirable industrie, as being
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:2594:112"/> much addicted to the publicke good are very rich) a dwelling house being likewise allowed them for their liues: and each Citie or towne according to the proportionable bignesse, hath moe or fewer of those stipendiarie Physitians: and none among them admitted, but such as for their sufficiencie, and long time spent in the studie of that profession, haue taken their degrees in some famous Vniuersitie. All the Apothecaries and Surgeons within the place where they liue are subiect to their censures, and by them to be controlled; and the midwiues likewise by them must be admitted.<note place="margin">They often visit the Apotheca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries shops, and take a suruey of his drugs.</note> And of all the Apothecaries drugs, as well simples as compounds, they take a narrow suruey twice a yeare; to wit, euery Spring and fall: besides the viewing of their drugs immediatly after the buying of them (which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth most commonly to passe twice a yeare, at Lerpzig or Franckfort faire) not being lawfull for them to make vse of any of them vntill such time as they be first visited and allowed by the aforesaid Physitians. At the viewing and visiting of their wares, is appointed one frō the chiefe Magistrate of the Citie, commonly called the Burger maister, to sit in commission with the Physitians. If the Apothecarie shall be found faultie, or his drugs any wayes vnsufficient, the aforesaid persons fine him at their pleasures; as also set a reasonable rate or taxe vpon all his drugs and compositions, and that according to the rising or fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of the prizes of the drugs.

The moderation of fees likewise, in regard of their standing stipends, is some ease to the purses of priuate men, but especially to the poorer sort, to whom by this meanes they are the betrer enabled to affoord their counsell for little or nothing. The countrey round about findeth likewise euery where learned Physitians to aduise with, as also good and sufficient stuffe, neither fustie nor sophisticate, and that at a reasonable rate. Now how farre we come short of this so laudable and worthie pollicie, those that know any thing are not ignorant.

But it is acknowledged of all true Physitians, that the ground and beginning of finding out aright the true method of curing diseases, is the knowledge of the disease, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the place seised with the same, which is not knowne by the bare inspection of the vrine onely, being but a doubtfull signe; but (as <hi>Galen</hi> saith well) the knowledge of the disease is collected by meanes of the place affected, together
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:2594:114"/> with the disposition of the same besides nature: which being the internall cause of the disease (or the disease it selfe) annoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the action, it is no maruell if the signes of each be common to both: and thus is the disease and place affected discerned and knowne, both by the parts of the substance therof, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents, adherents, the action interessed, together with the acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents of the disease, from the parts of the substance of the part affected: as if we shall perceiue any gristle of the windpipe to be spit vp with coughing, it doth argue and indicate to vs an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ulceration of the lungs, together with a consumption of the same. From the contents; as if thou shalt perceiue the chyle (that is, the meate receiued into the stomacke and a little al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered) or the ordure issue out of a wound, thou mayest from thence safely collect that either the stomack, or guts are woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. Such things also as do adhere or grow to the part, do both declare the disease and the part annoyed therewith. For if vpon a fracture of the scull there grow out little round lumps like vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to little mushromes, it doth argue the dammage and hurt of the membrane or skin couering the braines. No lesse doth the hurt of the action bewray as well the hurt of the organe and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument of it, as the disease it selfe: as the retention of the v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine doth argue an obstruction in the pipes conueighing the v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine from the kidneyes to the bladder: or the excessiue fluxe of the same being crude and not concocted, doth argue the indis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position of the kidneyes. Ioyne yet with the former, as most pregnant proofes and testimonies of the disease, these insepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble accidents of the same, commonly called <hi>pathognomonica,</hi> the which the disease it selfe doth procure and beget: as a stinging and pricking paine in the side, ioyned with a burning feauer, doth argue not onely a <hi>Pleurisie,</hi> but also that the skin or mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brane which enuironeth the ribs is inflamed. And vnto all the aforesaid signes thou mayest, if thou wilt, adde the intricate knowledge of the pulse of the arteries, rather then the vncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine iudgement by vrine: the which as we do not altogether reiect,<note place="margin">The great care of the ancient Physitians in searching out the signes of diseases.</note> so do we not attribute so much thereunto as these impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors do.

For such as cannot helpe, I see not how they can hurt me. No more can I conceiue what the Physitian can performe, as concerning the cure of the disease, being ignorant of the nature and estate of the same. For this cause the ancient Physitians did with great labour, trauell, and industrie, search out the cause, the nature and substance of the disease, from the which the indica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of remedies are deriued, and not from the vrine onely, but
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:2594:116"/> from the signes called Pathognomonicke, and from the whole concourse of the symptomes or accidents: who did likewise deuide Physicke principally into two parts, to wit, that which we commonly call Therapeuticke, whose most large and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon scope, is to cure diseases by contrary remedies: and into that part which we call Diagnosticke; whose most common scope is to discerne the whole and sound from the like, and the sicke and infirme from the whole, being vnlike the one to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. And this part of Physicke doth farre excell the other, to wit, the Therapeuticke, the which without the Diagnosticke is of small vse or profit. And because it did lay open the perfect and absolute knowledge of the disease, by meanes of the signes Pathognomonicke, proper and peculiar to euery disease, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the concurrence of accidents, which the Empiricks called <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">

                           </gap>, or that part of Physicke which handleth the signes of diseases. Wherefore we cannot but much wonder at <hi>Galen,</hi> a man of so great learning, who besides two hundreth and fiftie bookes written of diuerse sciences, and of all the other parts of Physicke aboue foure hundreth; all being likewise written in so good order and method, that notwithstanding he hath not brought to full perfection this so noble a part of Physicke, called Diag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nosticke, but onely dispersedly here and there, especially in that booke called the Constitution or ordering of the Art of Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicke, hath as it were sowne some seeds of the same. But yet <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uicenna, Rhazes,</hi> and other Arabian Physitians, and such among the Greeks as haue written of late after <hi>Galen,</hi> as <hi>Paulus, Aegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neta, Aetius, Actuarius,</hi> and <hi>Alexander Trallianus,</hi> following the footsteps of the ancient Empiricks, did collect and gather together in euery seuerall Chapter which did discourse of the disease, a great number of the signes and seuerall accidents of the same: but so confusedly and indistinctly, that hardly coul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest thou discerne one manner of signe from another: insomuch as thou mayest, not without cause, call their Diagnosticke Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicke, the confused chaos of <hi>Democritus.</hi> And further they do
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:2594:117"/> not instruct vs sufficiently what signe of the disease doth argue or shew foorth the greater or smaller strength. But there is in Germanie at this day,<note place="margin">And in England also.</note> a sort of idle prating fellowes, more foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish then any others, who, as if all the signes of euery disease were to be seene in the vrine, are not ashamed, by the sole and bare inspection thereof, to prate and pronounce sentence con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the substance of the disease, and the life and death of the diseased, as hath bene said alreadie. To the end therefore that their impudencie may be made manifest, and layd open to euery one, I purpose to insert something in this Epistle concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the differences of signes, to the end that I may minister occasion to some others more learned then my selfe, to handle the same by an absolute &amp; exquisite method: the which taske I will also willingly vndertake for the good of the sicke, if I may obtaine so much time and leisure, that at length this so hainous a fault, and worthy of no small punishment, may be banished from among the companie of all honest and ingenuous Physi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians, and a right and perfect method, as well for discerning as for curing,<note place="margin">Diuision of the signes.</note> may be set downe. Now it is granted, as well among Phylosophers as Physitians, that the effects and accidents do indicate and declare their causes. It is likewise well knowne, that the accidents are nothing else but the effects of the dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition of the disease. No man therefore can deny, that the acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents (of which number are also the actions interessed, and some things which essentially do adhere thereunto) do indicate and declare, as well the disease as the place affected, as being the harbour and receptacle of the same, and vnto which the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies ought to be applyed. Now as concerning the accidents, some of them are called by the Greekes <hi>Epiphaenomena,</hi> that is, such as do appeare indeed, but vanish away againe before the disease be at an end: others againe called <hi>Pathognomonica,</hi> which being of the essence of the disease, do both begin and end with the same. And these be inseparable and certaine signes of the disease, the concourse of which doth more certainly and truly declare vnto vs, the nature, manner, and kind of the disease, then any vrine can do. As a continuall feauer, together with a pric<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king and stinging paine in the side, a great cough and short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:2594:117"/> of breath, when as they concurre together, and come as it were all at one instant, are euident and certaine signes of a <hi>Pleuresie.</hi> But other accidents which do after succeed, are called <hi>Epiphaenomena</hi> or <hi>Synedreouonta,</hi> as if thou shouldest say, asses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors or assi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

As in a <hi>Pleuresie</hi> a red, bloudie, or yet yellowish spittle, a paine extending it selfe to the breast bone or neather part of the <hi>midriffe,</hi> watching, deliberation, and terrible dreames: these accidents are called assistant or accompanying, and do declare either the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of the disease; or else the mildnesse or malignitie of the same. Now it behooueth the Physitian to ponder and expend with himselfe in such a concourse of accidents equally, the strength of euery accident apart, and to compare together such as be dangerous, with the other which do promise greater secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie. For if those which are dangerous do vanquish and ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the strength and vigour of nature, either by their force or number, then mayest thou boldly pronounce, that danger is not farre from the doore. And againe on the contrary, if such as do promise securitie be of greater power then the former, then shall the sicke escape out of the deepe danger of <hi>Scylla</hi> and <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rybdis,</hi> and by the vertue and power of a happy <hi>Crisi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst such signes some are called <hi>Decretorie,</hi> or <hi>Iudicatorie;</hi> other signes of cruditie and concoction; others againe do fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell the securitie or danger of the disease. Now the signes of concoction,<note place="margin">Signes of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction.</note> after the beginning of the disease is past ouer, and the humours by meanes of the naturall heate, well concocted, sequestred, and separated from that which is putride and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt, do appeare about the time of the increasing or vigour of the disease, in the <hi>vrine, spittle, suppuration of Impostumes, (which is not vnlike vnto concoction performed in the veines)</hi> as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so in other excretions: for the excretions of euery part of the
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:2594:118"/> body, as also of the humours, which are nothing else but the superfluities and relickes of concoction, do shew foorth the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>disposition of the same. Wherefore in the infirmities of the chest, and instruments of respiration, a spittle white, euen of an equall consistence, is alwayes a good and laudable signe of concoction. But if the sicke be not at all able to spit out any thing, then doth it shew foorth absolute cruditie; and if he should chance to spit a spittle without any mixture, being thin, waterish, &amp; of a leaden colour, or of the colour of verdigrease, it doth not onely argue cruditie, but doth also portend the vtter ouerthrow of the patient. But the vrine being an excretion of the second concoction, doth certainly shew foorth the crudity and concoction of the humours contained in the veines, guts, liuer, and places adioyning, the said parts being annoyed, either with feauer, inflammation, Scirrhus, or yet any other distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per whatsoeuer. For if the same both in colour and substance be like vnto such vrines as are vsually seene in perfect health, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing a residence white, euen, and like vnto well concocted matter, it doth truly witnesse vnto vs, not onely the concoction of the disease, especially in feauers, but also that the naturall force and power is a great deale stronger then the disease, and therefore that it is like to obtaine the victorie in the conflict with the crisis.<note place="margin">Vrine no Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thognomonick signe of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction, and yet to be obserued.</note> But by this meanes the vtine is no Pathogno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monicke signe, and yet a necessarie signe of concoction and cruditie, and worth the obseruing in feauers, diseases of the neather belly or intrails, and places adioyning to them. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Galen</hi> in the exposition of the predictions of <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> doth grant, that the vrine doth shew foorth and demonstrate the state and disposition of the parts of the liuer, kidneyes, and bladder; as likewise of the strength or weaknesse of the vessels containing the bloud, and of the naturall power and vertue which is the ingenderer of the humours: howbeit the same <hi>Galen</hi> againe affirmeth, that there are other Pathognomonicke signes belonging to the braines, lungs, mother, sinewes, &amp;c. And yet notwithstanding, might one, not without cause, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uouch, that the vrine giueth notice of some infirmities of the place through which it passeth, not primarily and principally,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:2594:118"/> but by accident, to wit, by reason of the contents thereof, which are nothing else but excretions proceeding from those parts which do conueigh and carrie the vrine. Wherefore <hi>Hippocra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes</hi> witnesseth, that if any do void by vrine, either <hi>grauell,</hi>

                           <hi>or little thinne scurfe, or matter like vnto scales, or coursest dressings of bran, little gobbets of flesh, congealed bloud, matter or small haires or threeds, like vnto the small veines knit together vnder the creuices taile;</hi> these things declare that the bladder is annoyed with a scab, and the kidneyes with the stone, suppuration, the rup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of some veine, or some other infirmitie. But lest any should rashly apply the signes of vrine to any other then the aforena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med diseases, this famous father of Physitians doth adde imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly: <hi>Take heed therefore lest thou be deceiued, the party making such an vrine when the bladder is amisse; for then such vrines belong not to the whole body, but ought to be referred to the bladder onely.</hi> There is yet another fearefull and dangerous disease belonging to the kidneyes, called <hi>Diabete</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Diabete.</note> or <hi>Poldropsy;</hi> being an extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarie fluxe of the vrine, called of the Greekes by reason of this vnsatiable desire of drinking <hi>Dipsacus.</hi> This disease is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerable to the disease called <hi>Lienteria:</hi> and for this cause they are continually forced to drinke, all which being nothing at all changed, in colour, substance, or in smell, they do voide forth againe as they receiued it, and that by reason of the imbecillity of the returning and altering powers and faculties of the kid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neyes. Now that such an vrine is the proper and pathognomo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicke signe of this disease, no man of vnderstanding, I thinke, will denie. Followeth now the third sort of signes of conco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of superfluities, to wit, the excretions of the bellie, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the first concoction; the which being soft, fashio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned according to the concauitie of the guts, and somewhat fastened or stiffe, being also voyded at the accustomed time, and answering in proportion to the food receiued: then, as saith <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> they do shew forth and declare the strength of the naturall faculties of the stomacke, together with the good di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gestion thereof. These three sorts of superfluities then giue par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular notice of the proper state and disposition of such parts of the bodie as they passe thorow, together with the strength of
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:2594:119"/> the naturall powers: and first the superfluities of the meate do argue and declare the force and strength of the stomacke. For this cause the Emperour <hi>Antoninus</hi> his groomes of his stable did daily both taste and smell to the ordure of his stately horse, knowne by his greene furniture, to know whether he had well digested his food or not. Now the vrines are signes of the state of the bloud in the <hi>veines,</hi> and disposition of the <hi>Liuer,</hi> which is appointed to be the hote harth or kitchin for concoction of the humours. The spittle in diseases of the chest, is vnto vs a signe and token of concoction or cruditie: and those of the first sort, to wit, of cruditie, are for the most part euill, and often proue very dangerous: the others againe are often messengers of an healthfull and long looked for <hi>crisis:</hi> whence is this saying of <hi>Hippocrates: Concoction doth portend and signifie both the spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinesse of the crise and assured health: but on the contrarie, cruditie doth menace and threaten either the breaking forth of some tumour, or great swelling, or else some great paine or griefe, or yet a relapse into the same disease againe.</hi> There are yet many moe decretorie signes which concerne the future <hi>crise,</hi> as also diuerse progno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticke signes foreshewing life or death, the full explication of which would rather require a great volume then an Epistle (the which haue bene exactly described by <hi>Hippocrates,</hi>) but especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally the intricate signes of prediction by the pulse, as also the signes both of the disease it selfe, and of the place affected or interessed; the which also I willingly passe ouer, by reason that their power, force, efficacie, and signification, doth depend vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the signes of concoction; neither are there any amongst all the signes of concoction more necessarie for the Physitians vse, then these <hi>pathognomonicke</hi> signes. And tell me, I pray thee, how shall the Physitian euer be able to cure vncouth and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne diseases, vnlesse the <hi>pathognomonicke</hi> signes first lay them open to his view and consideration; in the finding out of which, the ancients tooke so great paines, as hath bene said al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>readie. But since it is not the worke of the Physitian, but of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, to concoct and cure diseases, it shall be very needfull for the Physitian to know assuredly the vigor and strength of the naturall power and force, whether it be like to ouercome the
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:2594:119"/> disease, or to faint vnder the burden of it▪ by which meanes we shall attaine vnto more certaine and assured signes of life and death, then euer did those soothsayers and wizards, whom the Romanes did maintaine for the benefit of their sicke people; whose prophecies and predictions no man of sound iudgement will euer beleeue to containe any matter of truth. But such prognosticke signes as are collected from concoction, are so firme and sure, that <hi>Galen</hi> doth boast and brag, that he was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer by them deceiued. Now our pisse-prophet Physitians are either vtterly ignorant of them, or else notwithstanding set light by them: who, notwithstanding, sitting idle at home, are nothing at all ashamed, by the vrine alone to deliuer their <hi>Del<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phian</hi> oracles concerning all diseases: who neuerthelesse, haue neuer so much as tasted of this so noble part of Physicke called <hi>diagnosticke,</hi> without the which the other, to wit, <hi>therapeu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticke,</hi> can neuer subsist: yet are they neither ashamed to assume vnto themselues the cure of vnknowne diseases, nor yet to arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate and vsurpe the name of Physitians.

But alas, so farre are we from banishing this abuse, that many of good worth amongst our selues, haue required, and do yet require, not of my selfe alone, but of many others also both iudicious and learned Physitians, that by the sole inspection of the v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine, without any further inquisition or artificiall coniecture going be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, we should Prophet-like tell them, whether the vrine be a mans or a womans; of what age the partie is, what is the nature of the disease; as also what the antecedent and primitiue cause of the disease may be: and whether they haue contracted the same by drinking of bad
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:2594:121"/> wines, by eating too many puddings, or any such like thing. Now if thou shalt herein professe thy selfe ignorant, and canst not Lyncius-like see all this and more in the vrine, thou shalt heare them reply, thou art a dunce, knowing nothing, and that they haue bene with them who haue told them wonders by the water. Thou seest then how ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surd an opinion is crept in, not among the vulgar sort onely, but euen among many others also, who would seeme to be of a more refined vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding; as also what great danger doth from hence arise. But yet when as in some cases, with certaine cautions, we do attribute some certainty to the vrine, in giuing vs some notice either of the securitie of the disease, or yet the danger of the same: we are so farre from maintaining and vpholding such base bold varlets, that we desire no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more, then the driuing of such dunces out of all well gouerned countries and commonwealthes.</p>

The paine was for certaine dayes without inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission, howsoeuer sometimes some remission might be obserued: as likewise both in her pulse and vrine signes of a feauer did plainly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare. After I had vsed diuers meanes of diuersion, as well by Phlebo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomie and attractiue glisters, as by other meanes, not neglecting hyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noticke, cordiall, and deoppilatiue medicines, according to the seue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall occurrences, the disease gaue her some reasonable time of inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission, with some alleuiation of the accidents. The vrine also after a few dayes, began to flatter vs with a faire and laudable colour, short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly seconded with contents answerable. The pulse played his part also, and dissembled as well as his neighbour. The Gentlewoman to any outward appearance, the very day before her death, was like to haue liued many, not onely dayes but yeares also: mouing and stirring with great alacritie and chearefulnesse vp and downe her chamber, busied about her ordinarie employments. When behold, he who spareth not the mightiest Monarchs, on an euening knocking suddenly, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands his debt long before his day, and would scarce allow her full two houres respit for the payment of the same.

The which hath made many, lest they should be discredited among the vulgar, cunningly sometimes to learne what they could concerning other signes of conception, and vpon the sight of the vrine, make them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue they had found out the whole truth by meanes thereof: and others againe, when as they could learne nothing, haue vpon some presumptions and probabilities put all to the ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and told them that which they most longed after: and if the prediction happened right, then was this person admired as more then a mortall man: but if otherwise, then might he looke for a mocke or flout for his paines, besides the imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ignorance and insufficiencie. Howbeit some are yet more cunning then others, to impute the fault to some other accident, by this meanes still maintaining the ignorant in their former error. This hath bene a great meanes that hitherto the people hath bene gulled, hauing conceiued a sinister and wrong opiniō of the honest &amp; learned Physitian, who would not sooth them vp in the same errour. For the better confutation of this point, my purpose is,<note place="margin" type="runSum">Arguments e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uincing that by the sole inspe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine, it cannot be discerned whether a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man be with child or no.</note> first to propound some reasons against the same: and in the next place shall march some authorities of the learned: and in the last place something shall be added out of mine owne experience. Now in the first place, according to the common rule set downe, and confirmed by a number of learned writers, <hi>That the vrine ordinarily giueth vs notice of such diseases as are contained within the veines, as also of such places
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:2594:126"/> through which it passeth,</hi> it is apparent, that the conception par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipateth of neither. For in the first place, it is apparent and manifest, that the matrix or wombe is none of those parts con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained within the veines: neither yet in the next place, doth the vrine passe through the same. How then is it possible to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue any infirmitie of this part by the vrine? Now besides, the bladder and the wombe are two distinct and seuerall parts, appropriated to seuerall ends and vses. And put yet the case that sometimes something might be, by reason of the neare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of the two orifices, conueyed through the common pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage, yet this would but seldome come to passe. And moreouer in women with child this conueyance could not be granted, in regard of the exact shutting vp of the aforesaid passage during the whole time of this burden, insomuch that the least super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluitie can then haue no passage,<note place="margin">In aphor. <hi>51.</hi> &amp; <hi>54.</hi> lib. <hi>6</hi> &amp; <hi>3.</hi> de natur. facult. cap. <hi>3. 6.</hi> de locis af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect. cap. <hi>5. 15.</hi> de vsu part.</note> as witnesseth <hi>Galen</hi> in diuers places. Now if any will deny the truth of this point, in the first place I answer, that as I grant that sometimes there may be, notwithstanding that which hath bene said, some euacuation during that time, and that some part of the same matter might be conueyed into the bladder, yet this cometh to passe but ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry seldome, and in a few. And againe, this would make more against them: for all that is by the learned at the most granted in this case is, that the vrine may sometimes declare a retention and stopping of the menstruous fluxe, whereof if any part du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring their being with child is voyded foorth (as sometimes some women haue some to spare) the vrine can no more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare any stoppage of this fluxe, and by consequent nothing concerning the conception, vnlesse thou wouldest imagine that there be certaine <hi>ideas</hi> or shapes and pictures of young children conueyed at that time into the vrines of women with child. And yet if this were true, who told these vrine-mongers that the wombe daunced attendance on the bladder, to voyde their seuerall excretions at one and the same time? But put yet the case that some part of this menstruous fluxe, now and then issuing out at the common conduit with the vrine, might shew vs something, yet could it not follow, but that a number of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther signes were also necessarie, as hereafter shall appeare.
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:2594:126"/> Their chiefe ring-leader <hi>Actuarius</hi> himselfe, confesseth that the vrine alone is not able to leade vs vnto this truth. Moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer <hi>Aristotle</hi> acknowledgeth,<note place="margin">Arist. <hi>4.</hi> de gener. anim. cap. <hi>6.</hi>
                        </note> that the vrines of women with child do differ according to the time that is past since the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception; so that there is not one certaine vrine whereon to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose our iudgement. And according to the opinion of diuerse others, the vrines of women with child alter almost euery day. One of these vrines therefore shall neuer giue notice of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, although it might be sometimes discerned by the v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine. And is not this absurditie, to presume to know that by one signe, which many ioyned together can hardly declare vnto vs? Diuerse contents are set downe by some authors following <hi>Auicenna,</hi> which are said to be found in such <hi>vrines,</hi> which ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthelesse, haue bene often obserued as well in the vrines of citizens as countrey people of the malekinde, who I am sure, were neuer so much as suspected to be with child. <hi>A certain pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cticall Professor of the vniuersity of Pisa in Italie (saith Scribonius) a graue ancient Physitian, was wont to say,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Guil. Adolph. Scribon. lib. de vrin. inspect.</note>
                        <hi>that such as trusted most to this prediction, were most of all deceiued; and yet he neuer yet in his life time had obserued any such vrines in women with child, as Aui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenna describeth: and that moreouer he had often obserued such contents in mens vrines.</hi> Adde yet this argument to the former, that the conception, as also the further growth of the child in the wombe, is properly a naturall action, and no disease at all: for this cause their vrines ought to differ little or nothing from other healthfull womans waters, especially in the first moneths, as I haue my selfe often obserued. Againe what if a woman with child be surprised with some acute disease, as commeth often to passe, will this then thinke you, make no alteration in the v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine? And if there were any certainty in this signe alone, what needed our Physitians trouble themselues with so many? and oftentimes all will not serue the turne. Let it therefore re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine firme and stable, that no certainty can be collected by the sole obseruation of this signe, and that to maintaine the same, is nothing else but meere imposture and cozenage. But that this is not mine owne priuate opinion onely, I will now make it appeare: heare therefore some of our learned Physiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:2594:127"/> deliuer their owne minds, that out of the mouth of many witnesses this truth may be confirmed. Let <hi>Rondeletius</hi> first speake.</p>

                        <hi>It would seeme (saith he) iustifiable, as well by reason as by expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, that the vrine may giue vs certaine and assured notice of a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans being with child. And D. Gabride said, he knew it as assuredly as if he had seene a child in the vrine. But of another opinion are all the ancient Physitians, who haue left vs no signes of the same in the vrine: as also reason it selfe teacheth vs no lesse. For since the birth or conception is without the veines, and the vrine chiefly giueth vs no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of such diseases as are contained within the veines, it can giue vs no certaine assurance of this matter, vnlesse we ioyne therewith all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther signes, as the retention of her monethly disease, swelling of her bellie, she, notwithstanding enioying her perfect health. &amp;c.</hi>

No more am I of that opinion, that a Physi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian may assuredly know by the vrine whether a woman be with child or no; by reason that of all the signes which Hippocrates hath in diuers places set downe, there is not one that we can certainly trust to.</hi>
                     </p>

                        <hi>as well the action of the stomacke, as the appetite and concoction vse ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily to be troubled. And yet such is the blockishnesse and stupiditie of some Physitians, that they are perswaded women with child make vrines differing from other womens. It is true, that in women with child, that bloud which was wont to be voyded monethly, is now stayed and kept in, wherefore because the same in the first moneths especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, not being wholly spent on the nourishment of the child, as being then but small, it commeth to passe that the action of the stomacke, as like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise the appetite, together with the concoction are not a litle troubled. And therefore being often, by reason of their longing desires, carried away with a desire of such things as engender little good nourishment, they engender great store of crudities, which may plainly be seene by their vrines, the which are also common to all such as abound in cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>To the former we will adde yet a late writer of the same na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, because he speaketh so plainly and to the purpose.<note place="margin">Iean Marinello de Formie lib. <hi>3.</hi> chap. <hi>5.</hi> de mala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die des femmes.</note> The booke was first written in the <hi>Italian</hi> tongue, and since transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into <hi>French,</hi> out of the which I haue translated this parcell.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Truth it is, that we must not altogether relie vpon the vrine, to know whether a woman be with child or no. For the vrine can giue thee no further assurance of the same, then by the retention of her ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>customed monethly course, and by the which we do commonly collect some presumption of conception. Now it may easily come to passe, that a woman may be surprised with many infirmities, which may hide and darken the principall signe of conception (if any there were) in the v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine: such as be headach, any cold, especially being accompanied with a cough, cruditie, or indigestion of the stomacke, great paine in the kidneyes, &amp;c. And which is yet more, the eating of raw fruite, sallets, milke, porke, pease, sperage, cabbage, artichocks, mushromes, and many other such kind of food, not being ordinarie or vsuall to the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, are sufficient to alter and change, not the colour onely, but the contents of the vrine also. Moreouer the vrine doth most properly and assuredly declare vnto vs, the infirmities of the parts from whence it commeth, and through the which at length it passeth. For the which cause it is more then manifest, that there is no assured knowledge to be
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:2594:128"/> had by the vrine concerning the conception, no more then by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of her monethly course, since that without conception the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said retention and stopping is found, as well in maides as in married women. The last and most certaine signe of conception is, when as the child beginneth to stirre and moue.</hi>

The Physitian vpon the bare sight of the vrine onely, did peremptorily affirme, that she was for certaine with child, and that of a boy. After the which time Rithamerus began quite to distaste me; and that onely by reason that vpon the sight of her vrine, together with diuers other signes and circumstances thereto belonging, I had deliuered my opinion, that she was not at all with child. And besides, he prouided with all expedition both midwife, nurse, and all other things belonging to that businesse. It was afterwards constantly and confidently euery where noysed abroad, that she was with child. The women her attendants, by reason of some accidents wherewith she was
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:2594:128"/> now and then troubled, appointed her diuerse baths, by meanes where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of being surprised with the falling sicknesse, she was in a very short time freed from all the miseries of this mortall life. Of whose death being aduertised, I did very earnestly intreate the aforesaid Ritha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merus, that both in regard of that ancient bond of loue and amitie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt him and me, as likewise to finde out the whole truth of this matter, he would be pleased to giue way to the opening of the dead corps. The which at length, being ouercome, as well by my earnest suing vnto him, as for the great and earnest desire he had to be resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued of the truth of the matter, he did willingly yeeld vnto. In making the incision, we began first with the muscles of the neather bellie, disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uering such parts as before were hid, &amp; afterwards ripping vp the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritonaeum, we proceeded to the place where the wombe was situate; and although we did perceiue it to be but very small, and to containe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing within it; yet to the end we might the more clearly see the truth with our eyes, we ript it vp also, and found it cleane, and empty of any thing within it. Now in her life time she was of a whitish bleake colour, and of a cachecticall disposition, and had neuer in all her life time borne any child: from whence I did by very probable coniecture collect, that she was troubled with some other infirmitie. For the which cause we proceed still in our incision towards the stomacke; whereas betwixt the peritonaeum, and the guts we found good store of water, which did ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the motion of the body, fall sometimes to the right and sometimes to the left side; and from hence arose this erronius opinion of the supposed motion of a liue child. This being after this manner finished, I spake after this manner, My good friend George, you see now after what manner your wife proueth with child. And he, seeing the case so plaine, did ingenuously acknowledge, that he had wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully and vndeseruedly bene offended with me, and withall did freely acknowledge his errour.

                        <hi>A Gentlewoman dwelling neere Northampton some yeares ago, sent me her vrine, which in euery respect, as well in colour as contents,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:2594:129"/> resembled the vrine of an healthfull yong man. Hauing found out by some circumstances that it was a womans, I began to suspect that which afterwards proued true, that she was with child. The mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senger demanding whether she was not entred into a Dropsie: I repli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, I rather enclined to the opinion that she was with child, the which proued to be true. The seruant confessed, another Physitian had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore put her in needlesse feare of a Dropsie. The Gentlewoman after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards conceiued a better opinion of my skill in this point, then I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse it deserued.</hi>

The vrine sent resembled, as the former, the vrine of a lustie young man in the Aprill of his age: I obserued it very narrowly, and yet could I discerne none of those Arabian contents, neither carded wooll, flaxe, nor huswiues cloth. Being afterwards with her, I found no alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration in her vrine, saue that it was paler coloured which was made in the night, and higher coloured which was made in the day timc, contrarie to that which we commonly obserue; and yet neither of them exceeding the colour of a cholericke mans vrine. The Gentlewoman had bene for a long time, euen before her being with child, much troubled with a hote and feauer-like distemper.</hi>

                        <seg rend="decorInit">N</seg>O lesse absurd an opinion then the former, is it to hold that the sexe may absolutely by the vrine be discerned. As for the sexe in the wombe, the same reasons which were brought against the discerning of the concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by the vrine, will here take hold also. As for the discerning of the sexe in those of riper yeares, the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:2594:129"/> would seeme to be more fauourable. The chiefe and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall reason alledged for this is, because men are commonly of an hoter constitution then women, which is the cause that their vrines are dyed of an higher colour; and moreouer, that the contents in womens vrines, in regard of their idle and seden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarie life, do often exceed mens in quantitie. But this must not simply be considered, but as we commonly say, <hi>caeteris paribus:</hi> that is, a man of a good and laudable constitution of body, v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing diet answerable both in quantitie and qualitie, and auoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding idlenesse: a woman likewise of a colder complexion, as often they are, vsing moderate diet, a sedentary and lazie life, auoyding hote diet. If, I say, one should bring thee two such vrines, demanding to know which were the mans and which the womans, then without great difficultie mightest thou giue out a right verdict. But if one shold bring vnto thee two vrines, the one of a man, the other of a woman, the one not differing from the other, and the womans perhaps higher in colour and thinner in substance, (which may by diuerse meanes come to passe) thou shouldest giue wrong sentence, then being thus gulled, thou mightest be made a gazing stocke to thy neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, by reason of thy peremptorie opinion. Now that some women are of an hoter constitution of bodie then some men,<note place="margin">Some women of an hoter con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution then men.</note> I thinke who so denieth, deserueth rather to haue his pate purged, then to be dealt with with by any reason. I my selfe haue also knowne many a man make paler vrines, with greater quantitie of contents, then women: which may easily come to passe, by reason of great quaffing, daintie fare, and abundance of ease and idlenesse, the engendrers of all manner of crudities. Haue we not now adayes more then a good many whose God is their guts, <hi>Fruges consumere nati,</hi> on whose vrines thou mightest long looke, before thou couldst discerne any thing materiall or to the purpose? As for our women, what if their <hi>Liuer</hi> and <hi>Kid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neyes</hi> be hote, as I haue not seldome obserued, may not this bring forth an high water? and will not obstructions easily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priue it of contents. But especially if these women be well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with a pipe of Tobacco, a cup of good sherry Sacke, Malago, or Canary, or yet a cup of good nappy Ale well brewed
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:2594:130"/> with sugar, nutmegge and ginger, may it not now and then not onely colour the vrines, but make their faces flourish with some orientall carbuncles and rubies? Besides the former reasons, will not fasting, watching, perturbations of the mind, diet in quantitie and qualitie, with diuerse other things moe, alter the vrine as well in man as in woman? It were, perhaps, an easier matter to obserue this difference in some hoter climat then our owne, to wit, in <hi>France, Spaine,</hi> or <hi>Italy,</hi> where women drinke more water then with vs; especially in <hi>Italie,</hi> where the women are caged vp like linnets to sing, and are not so busie with the fruite of the grape, nor with the strong barley water as our <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tish</hi> women. If I should instance also in our virgins, more man-like then many men, how were any able to contradict it? But if I should send to the cunningest pisse-prophet in this king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome the vrine of some <hi>Hermaphrodite</hi> or man-woman, what would or could they say? and to which of the sexes would they ascribe the vrine? Now that some such are to be found, cannot be denied. It hath bene holden for a truth in all ages: and of late yeares a learned Physitian hath written a booke concerning that subiect,<note place="margin">Gaspar. Bauhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus de Herma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phroditis.</note> where he bringeth in a number of histories of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient and later times. I haue bene also credibly informed of some such who haue liued here in these parts of the countrey. But if the woman shall be surprised with any hote and acute disease (as the vrine is seldome sent to the Physitian but in sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse) will not these confound thy iudgement? Now if the sexe cannot be discerned by the vrine in persons of yeares, what ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surditie is it to demand the knowledge hereof in a woman with child, where the conception it selfe cannot be thereby discer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned? as also where there are so many rubs in the way. It is also worth the obseruation, that whereas that learned. <hi>Mercatus</hi> discourseth of all the signes whereby one may know whether a woman be with child of a male or female, where he omitteth not so much as the blowing of the wind, yet speaketh he not so much as one word concerning the vrine: no more do many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther authors of best note.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Iean Marinello</hi> among many moe, setteth downe many signes to discerne the sexe in the wombe, yet speaketh he not so much
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:2594:130"/> as one word of the vrine. Other authors for breuitie I will passe by. I cannot but wonder what should moue our vrine-mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers to be so peremptory in this their opinion of discerning the sexe by the vrines, as though there were some specificall diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence alwayes to be obserued in these vrines: are not the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours alike, and the parts as well semilare as organicall alike in both these sexes? But I will acquaint thee with one historie concerning the prediction of a Parson-physitian, who would certifie a Gentlewoman with child of what sexe it was.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>A Gentlewoman dwelling within a few miles of Northampton,</hi>

                        <hi>left with child of her late deceassed husband, was very desirous to be certified of the sexe if it were possible. The reason was, because that if a sonne, then was he to be heire to great lands and possessions, which otherwise were entailed to the next heires male. This Parson being by many reputed famous in vromancie, this Gentlewoman had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course to his oracle. The Parson is peremptorie that she is with child of a sonne. The Gentlewoman and her friends reioyce not a little. But the worst is yet behind: the Parsons prediction proues false, and he a lying Prophet: she is brought to bed of a daughter, and her mirth tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned into mourning. If he had euer learned his Phylosophie, he might haue learned that,</hi> De futuris contingentibus non est determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta veritas: Of future things not yet come to passe, being contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent, no man can assuredly foretell the issue and euent. <hi>But thou mayest here see ex vnguibus Leonem: what manner of men these be.</hi>

                        <hi>purposing (according to his vsuall custome) to take some preuenting Physicke in the Spring of the yeare, wished his vrine to be sent to me. The vrine which was sent was of an high and deepe dyed red colour, of a meane substance, a copius red residence. Meeting with him the same day, I asked him whether he complained not of some heate: who replyed, he felt no manner of distemper at all. I wished him yet once againe to send me his vrine, which if it should so continue, I doubted Phlebolomie would be requisite. The next vrine was of a pale st<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

Enquiring afterwards into the cause of this diuersitie of vrines in so short a space, his wife told me, that her vrine had the first day bene sent in stead of her husbands. I required
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:2594:131"/> of her, whether she did not complaine of any inward distemper of heate; who replyed, that she complained of no distemper at all. But within a few dayes she found that distemper in such a measure, as she was glad to admit both of Phlebotomie and other fit and necessarie remedies. The constitution of her bodie is hote, and her vrine answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably high coloured, vnlesse it be accidentally hindered. And this I dare boldly affirme, that during her husbands sicknesse, being a long and tedious, first Tertian, then double Tertian feauer, yet neuer saw I his vrine of so high and intense a colour as that of hers lately mentioned.</hi>

Hence also cometh it to passe, that they affirme that the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents of the vppermost region do declare and lay open the griefes of the head, &amp;c. Did those men euer see fat fall to the bottome or mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle region of the vrinall? Doth not oyle and any fat thing commonly and of its owne accord swim vpon the top of the vrine? Neither yet doth it therefore necessarily follow, that the head is principally affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted; but doth declare and shew foorth, either the wasting of the whole bodie, or some diseases of the kidneyes. Let them shew vs the residence called</hi> hypostasis, <hi>in the garland or vppermost part of the vrine. The like may be said concerning the bubbles which do alwayes stay vpon the top of the vrine,</hi>

How often are such people pained with the wind Colicke or Hypochondriacke melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly? In which case howsoeuer some wind may ascend vp into the head; yet is not this axiome alwayes of vndoubted truth.

                        <hi>I was sollicited to affoord my presence and best counsell to a Parson, dwelling within some foure miles of the towne of Northampton, surprised with a burning feauer. Hauing diligently enquired what remedies he had hitherto vsed (for if I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member right, it was the tenth day of his disease) and by whose pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription, I learned that no lesse then three at least, if not foure Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son-Physitians had administred to him, and then the most famous for Ʋromancie of all the countrey about: howbeit since that time some others are also crept into that societie. I enquired moreouer whether Phlebotomie had bene as yet vsed. They replyed that Phlebotomie had not bene so much as once mentioned by any of them, but that they had purged him, as I thinke with Diaprunum, and I remember not what else, and appointed him some cooling drinkes. His wife added moreouer, that one of them thinking to purchase himselfe some praise beyond his fellowes, would haue bribed Death with foue pounds worth of Aurum Potabile, which she willingly payed for, in hope of her hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands recouerie. But this importunate suter would haue no nay;</hi>
                        <note place="margin">This Parson a chiefe proctor for aurum pota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bile in North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amptonshire.</note>
                        <hi>but vrged still the payment of the debt he came to demand. I told them that Phlebotomie, in due and conuenient time administred, had proued a more soueraigne medicine for this disease, then all the gold of Ophir and both the Indies. I being by them much importuned to let him bloud, absolutely refused, his strength being now well nigh spent, and some ill signes (the vndoubted harbingers of death) offering them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:2594:135"/> to my eyes, administring onely some cordials. The next mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning I find all waxe worse and worse; howbeit his wife, shewing me his vrine, which before had bene thinne, and now setled to a thicke resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, a part whereof did sticke to the sides of the vrinall and staine the same, which she, beleeuing her neighbours, began to conceiue some better hope of his recouerie, and that onely vpon this false ground. I assured her of the contrary, which shortly afterwards pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued too true, and the same day, being Saturday I departed. The Monday after comes one of his former Physitians (not the Parson who ministred Aurum Potabile; for after the same he had no moe ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes left in his quiuer) who, if faire buttered speeches and perempto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie promises could cure diseases, he might cure more then euer did the Apostles: who then all too late letteth his patient bloud, who surui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued not long after the losse of this liquor of life, but dyed either that night, or the next morning very early, being about the fourteenth day from the beginning of his disease.</hi> One thing I must yet adde con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the signification of thicke vrines, which deserueth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension:<note place="margin">Absurd opinion of a Physitian, affirming one to be bewitched by the vrine onely.</note> to wit, <hi>That a Physitian maintained, that he could know by the vrine that any were bewitched:</hi> to wit, that such a ones vrine was thicke and muddie, and could not by any heate be turned, as they terme it. To whom it was no lesse learnedly then truly replyed, <hi>Did you neuer reade in Hippocrates of vrina confusa?</hi> I cannot but much maruell, that any man that had euer suckt in the principles and grounds of Physicke, should be so farre ouerseene, this being a peculiar propertie of such vrines, that they will not be turned by any heate whatsoeuer. It is then apparent, how little certaintie is to be collected concerning the iudgement of diseases, by the sole inspection either of thick or thinne vrines: to wit, that after many cautions and diuers interrogations, if thou meete with an vnderstanding messenger, and the vrine sent at a conuenient time, and all other circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances obserued (which neuerthelesse, seldome or neuer con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curre altogether) and thou thy selfe being wise and vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, mayest perhaps, learne something concerning the state of the disease, as cruditie and concoction; and it may be, some moe circumstances, and yet the strength of the patient (which is most materiall, and the vulgar neuer able to iudge of the
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:2594:135"/> same) together with many other circumstances, not to be neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected shall be concealed from thee: many of our countrey peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, being so ignorant that they thinke their neighbour not a whit amended, vnlesse he be able, as at other times, to fill his bellie with bag-pudding &amp; bacon. And moreouer the ordinary sort of people are seldome able to lay open either their owne or their neighbours infirmitie, they taking chiefly notice either of some accident common to many others, or else of some griefe most affecting them. But besides the premisses,<note place="margin">Many things alter the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine.</note> may not the thicknesse of the vrinall, the dimnesse of thy sight, the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse or defect of light, or yet if it be brought to thee at candle light (so sottish and absurd is the vulgar sometimes) make thee to faile in thy iudgement?

But what certaintie doth the smell of the vrine affoord vs? whosoeuer shall thinke to helpe his vncertaine coniectures by the same, <hi>should leape out of the frying pan (as the prouerbe saith) into the fire.</hi> In the first place it is to be obserued, that as well in sicknesse as in health, vrines may offer no pleasing smell to the nose, and yet the party may be free from any danger at al. But because healthfull folkes seldome send their vrines to the Physitian, we will let them passe,<note place="margin">Loco prius cita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to.</note> and come to the sicke. I will let <hi>Scribonius</hi> speake for me. <hi>Concerning the sicks vrine (saith he) most do teach vs that stinking vrines signifie putrefaction of humours, in so much that by the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of the smels, they take vpon them to iudge of the seuerall hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours so putrified.</hi> O wise woodcockes! <hi>I willingly yeeld to them, that stinke or strong smell doth argue putrefaction in such vrines: but of which parts shall this putrefaction be? whether of the bladder onely, or of the Liuer also, of the chest, or other members? Nay so farre off is the stinking smell from giuing vs any particular notice of the disease,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:2594:137"/> that it cannot so much as affoord vs any certaine generall knowledge of the same. For many sweet smelling simples (saith Montanus) may cause a most stinking vrine. Cholericke and hote complexioned men void often very strong smelling vrines, howsoeuer free frō any disease, as I haue often obserued in my selfe. And by what meanes, I pray thee, shouldst thou from the stinking smell of the vrine know putrefaction? or how can this putrefaction procure this stinking smell? If this were so, then would it necessarily follow, that whosoeuer were seised with a feauer proceeding from putrefaction of humours, should voyd stinking vrines, the which is most false. The truth of this assumption may from hence appeare, that for the most part among an hundred sicke of such feauers, scarce shalt thou find one of their vrines so to smell, nor yet their bloud at the opening of a veine. And for this cause well said Sauonarola in his treatise of Vrines, that there are other signes also to be obserued in the annoying of putrified members, if we purpose well and orderly to examine, trie and finde out any skill concerning vrines. And indeed a thousand causes there are which may alter and change their smell. By the smell then onely there can neuer be any certaintie collected to informe our iudgements concerning any disease.</hi> But I am afraid the Reader will take it ill, that I so long detaine him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong so vnpleasing smels;<note place="margin">Medici certe de hac iudicandi ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione scribentes digni essent, qui in dies lotium potare cogeren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur.

But yet if any purpose to practise this point, I wish him to go to the <hi>Arabians,</hi> who haue written so curiously concerning this point; and it may be, in regard of their aromaticall drugs, their vrines may be of better taste then those of our <hi>Europaeans,</hi> who feed on grosser food.

For as sometimes some of the most infamous stewes strumpets, infected it may be, with the poxe, do most curiously decke and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorne, by curious painting, sumptuous apparell, and such other enticing trickes, their lothsome and filthie carkasses, to the end they may more easily deceiue such as will be caught in their snares: doth it not often fare euen so with the colour of the v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine? For oftentimes when they make the fairest shew, doth not euen death knocke at the doore? My purpose is not here to make any phylosophicall discourse concerning the causes of co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours in generall, and then to apply the same to vrines in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, and so to insist vpon each seuerall colour: for this might proue too tedious, and perhaps, not so pertinent to the purpose we haue in hand. And yet, notwithstanding, I will say some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of each of the chiefe and principall colours; by the which it may more easily be conceiued, that the like deceit may be seene in the others like vnto them.<note place="margin">Palew and light saffron colour.</note> Now my purpose is to begin with that colour which is the best of all others, being as it were the rule and square whereby we do discerne and iudge of the failings and defects of all the rest. This colour is called in Latin <hi>Subrufus, subaureus,</hi> or <hi>subcroceus:</hi> and in English, palew, or light saffron. This colour our Physitians do generally account the best of all others, and that it best betokeneth exact conco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. Neither yet must this first and best colour arguing good concoction, be simply and in it selfe so considered, but restrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to flourishing age. For in old men, women and children, (whose vrines, especially childrens, do commonly decline to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards white and pale) it doth betoken that their bodies are too hote, either by reason of diet, exercise or some other meanes. But if one should bring vnto thee such an vrine, how couldst
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:2594:138"/> thou tell whether it were an old or a yong mans, a womans or a childs, the messenger not acquainting thee with the particular circumstances? It may be thou wilt say, the contents will make the case cleare. I answer, that many causes may depriue them of contents in part or altogether, as hereafter shall appeare in the contents: and how the substance may alter, hath bene said alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die. The common opinion is, the higher the colour is, the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter heat is argued; which opinion to be most false &amp; erronious, shall hereafter in other colours appeare. Besides, may not a little extraordinarie watching, fasting, <hi>rheubarb, saffron, madder roots,</hi> or such like, colour the vrine without any excesse of heat? And will the seuerall seasons of the yeare produce no alteration in the vrine? that I say nothing of an infinite number of other cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, which may in like manner alter them. But one signification of such a coloured vrine I cannot here passe by, which I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber I once read in an English vrine booke: to wit,<note place="margin">Called the key of vnknowne knowledge, or a shop of fiue windowes.</note> that a maide which maketh an vrine of this colour, desireth the companie of a man. Doth not our maister vrine-monger now diue into the depth of the matter? But good man, I know what, I can assure thee that <hi>Tom</hi> and <hi>Dicke</hi> in the countrey can tell as well, that <hi>Maud</hi> the dairy maide would be married, by the reflected rayes and benigne aspects of her superiour orbs vpon their hemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sphaers, and the suffering some syllibubs and some other com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities committed to her custodie, now and then to come into their possession; by this meanes hindering her mistresse to further her selfe in her suite: as the most cunning pisse-prophet in all the countrie shall do by the vrine, if he had as many eyes as euer had that watchfull <hi>Argus,</hi> or his nose weighed downe with spectacles. The <hi>sanguine</hi> and best complexioned (which by consequence should produce the best vrines) are not alwayes the most amorous. Many as ill coloured drabs as euer any hath seene, haue not sometimes bene behind the best complexioned Gentlewoman in the land in such a case.

                        <hi>The iudgement of diseases by the sole inspection of the vrine, is hard to attaine vnto, and of great difficultie: for sometimes it commeth to passe that the vrine, as well in colour as in all other points, doth shew it selfe of a very laudable conditiō to the view of any iudicious eye, when, notwithstanding, death standeth at the doore: the reason of this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that all diseases are not easily discerned, nor yet the dangers of them perceiued by the vrine alone; but such especially as haue their being in the bladder, veines, kidneyes and Liuer. As it came to passe anno</hi> 1581. <hi>in a yong man about</hi> 24. <hi>yeares of age newly married. This yong mans vrine being, as well in colour as contents, most like vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to an healthfull vrine, he being neither depriued of his accustomed appetite, either to meate or drinke, neither troubled with excessiue headeach, thirst, watching, anxiety and tossing of his body too and fro; nor yet distempered with any noysome heate which might by fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling be discerned. The pulse notwithstanding, being weake, frequent and swift with great inequalitie and feeblenesse, gaue vs some coniectures of I know not what kinde of feauer, the which now and then was not without some exacerbations. Hence was I of opinion, that the vitall facultie did then by little and little decay; the vse and necessitie whereof in euery action of this life is, not without great cause, thought to be of such weight and moment, that not onely doth it suffice as matter for the rest, but doth also stirre vp and perfect the same, in cherishing them after a most kinde and effectuall manner, in so much as no part of the body can enioy the benefit of nourishment without the influence of this vitall facultie.

In a few dayes were by vs administred all such meames, as either in reason or our daily experience we thought fittest to expell the cause of her disease, and restore her to her former health againe.

This colour of vrine, howbeit it hath many degrees, some being of an higher, and some againe of a lower coloured red: yet (saith <hi>Galen</hi>) all are coloured with a greater or smaller portion of bloud therewith mingled. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthelesse, that this same colour of vrine is procured by the mixture, more or lesse, not of bloud alone, but also of an high co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loured choller, ioyntly or seuerally according to the greater or smaller quantitie thereof, is not by a small number of learned Physitians maintained: as also that this same colour of vrine is often and vsually seene in hote and acute diseases, is not vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne to the very vulgar and vnlearned sort of people. Now a many causes may bring foorth this effect: this colour of vrine higher or lower appearing in a many hote and acute diseases; which would puzzle a good Physitian, by the bare sight of such an vrine,<note place="margin">Dangerous to let bloud vpon the bare sight of an high red coloured vrine.</note> to know what disease it were.

And as I deny not but that this may often prooue true; so on the other side, it is most certaine, that the vrine may be of such a colour, and yet either proceed from a cold cause, or else from some imbecillitie and weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, as cometh somtimes to passe in Dropsies, &amp;c.

                        <hi>and thinne substance for many dayes together, being very like to the vrines made in hote acute feauers. The aforesaid patient had vsed the aduice of diuers ancient learned Physitians, who had appointed him such meanes as are vsed for the cooling of hote Liuers. At length he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired to my selfe, at that time but a young Physitian. Looking on his vrine, and withall seeing it of so high a red colour, as also percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing him, who was there present, free from any feauer, I asked him whether heretofore he had complained of any: which he denyed, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding moreouer, that for some moneths by-past he had felt a chilnesse and coldnesse, together with a great extenuation or leannesse, and shortnesse of breath, ioyned with a generall decay of strength; as also that hitherto he had found no benefit by such meanes as he had vsed. All which hauing attentiuely heard, I thought good to keepe by me the said vrine vntill the next day, and then to view the residence thereof, the which was of a colour like vnto bloud, as being indeed no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing else but bloud, the vrine aboue it, being but very little, dyed with a pale yellow colour; shewing no signe or token at all of any feauer.
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:2594:141"/> For the which cause I did then collect, that there was no exorbitant heate in his Liuer, but a great weakenesse in the kidneyes, by reason whereof the ends of the small veines being opened and loosened, let some part of the bloud passe away. And therefore I tooke a new course for curing of the same, by vsing such meanes as were fit for the corro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borating and strengthening of the kidneyes and veines, not omitting fit And conuenient diet, and among other things, goats milke. And so at length the vrine came to its owne naturall colour againe, his bodie also enioying the benefit of nourishment as it was wont informer times: and thus in a short time recouered his vigour, strength, and former perfect health againe.</hi>

The stone continuing for some certaine space in the bladder, prooueth likewise sometimes the cause of this inconuenience, and that especially after riding, or some other violent motion of the bodie. In women also some part of their menstruous fluxe is sometimes intermingled with it. Sometimes againe the bloud issuing out of the gummes, being suddenly stopt, doth search for it selfe a passage through the bladder. The kidneyes being wounded, first doth bloud issue out by the vrines, and afterwards matter mingled with it: as it befell that woman which was stabbed in the loynes with a dagger, first voyding blouddie vrines, then afterwards mingled with matter, vntill such time as both the wound and the kidneyes were cured. And that this was a wound in the kidneyes, did plainly appeare, by some portion of the same taken out of the wound. The exulce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the kidneyes is also accompanied with bloudie vrine, after the which (vnlesse remedie be in due and conuenient time procured) matter doth follow. It is likewise sometimes seene, that decrepit old men do voyd vrines mingled with bloud,

After the iniection of an anodine, or mitigating glister, the paine was much eased, and withall the vrine became of a remisse and light colour, such as it was wont to be in his former health. After a short space his vrine reassumed againe its former high colour, vntill such time as by frequent reiteration of glisters, the vrine at length persisted in that laudable state and condition once before be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun, the bodie also without any artificiall meanes performed its ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie functions.</hi>

                        <hi>A Citizen of good account, about fiftie yeares of age,</hi>

                        <hi>being freed from a Quartane ague, which had held him for the space of foure or fiue moneths, fell into that kind of laske which we commonly call</hi> Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enteria. <hi>His excretions by stoole were very liquid and crude, and no remainder of the heate of the Ague to be discerned. His vrines also were of as high a red colour, as is at any time to be seene in the most violent burning feauers, or inflammations of the inward parts. But yet did I not build vpon any so rotten a foundation, but hauing a more watchfull eye on other matters, I thought it necessarie in the first place to haue a care of the stomach, and in the next place of the Liuer, both being by meanes of the former Quarterne ague, not a little
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:2594:142"/> weakened. For this end and purpose I prescribed his diet in qualitie hote and drie, allowing him for his drinke the best and strongest wines, such as are Sacke and Canarie. Physicall meanes were</hi> Diagalanga, Diatrion-pipereon, <hi>and such like. By continuance of which meanes, this much at length was obtained, that the faecall excrements did now shew forth good concoctiō, the vrines also as in his former perfect health. After all the premisses the aforementioned patient assuring himselfe of perfect health, did secretly fall againe to the too liberall drinking of beere. Immediatly after this disorder, the colour of his vrine was againe altred into an high deepe red, vndoubtedly declaring vnto vs, that sometimes the vrines receiue an high and deepe colour, by reason of the cruditie and coldnesse of the stomach.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Vrine some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times red by reason of the cruditie of the stomach.</note>
                        <hi>After that time therefore he refrained againe from beere, vpon the which his vrine returned to its former laudable condition, neither did he after that vse any beere, vntill such time as he had perfectly recouered his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer health againe.</hi>

                     <p>These things haue I related, because of the ignorance and error of many, who are perswaded, that the vrine cannot be died with so high a colour, any other way then by heate, who whensoeuer they see such an vrine brought to them, the patient being tormented with the Collicke, they very vnaduisedly and rashly haue recourse to the cure of a feauer, neglecting the cure of the Collicke, which by these meanes they are so farre from curing, that they do rather much increase the paine of the same.

                     <p>And thus may the deceit and vncertaine iudgement had by the varietie of these red vrines in hote or cold diseases easily be conceiued, for the which cause I will here surceasse from in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting any more vpon them: but now, because mention hath bene made of some small quantity of bloud issuing foorth with the vrines, we will say something of the abundant pissing of bloud, illustrating it by some authorities, as heretofore we haue done.</p>
                     <p>Now as these vrines of an high and intense red colour,<note place="margin">Of pissing of bloud.</note> do strike a terrour often in the beholders, much more doth this li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor of life (the bloud it selfe I meane) issuing out of the vrina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie pipes and passages, cause no small amazement to the eyes of the ignorant, and sometimes of the more iudicious beholder of it. And yet doth not this alwayes portend so infallible and vndoubted danger, as by many is deemed. Sometimes indeed the danger is so great, that not onely a meane and ordinarie vnderstanding, but a more refined iudgement, may iustly feare the future danger: as in the rupture of some great veine neare the Liuer, or the kidneyes, after which doth an vlcer often en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue, and after a long torturing and tormenting paine, Death most commonly maketh an end of their so miserable and pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full life. Sometimes againe this fluxe prooueth very safe and

                     <p>Some men there are, who by certaine turnes, and at certaine times do pisse bloud abundantly, being a disease not vnlike to the haemorrhoides or piles.

But if at this accustomed and wonted pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod of time, there shall happen a suppression or stoppage of the aforesaid fluxe, they are presently surprised with a great head-ach, their eye-sight waxing dim, seconded with a giddi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and swimming in the head.

<pb n="73" facs="tcp:2594:143"/> vpon his iourney homewards to Mantua, and fast asleepe in his Inne, being accompanied with another friend, who lay in the same bed with him, vpon the sudden there issued out at his yard, of its owne accord, great store of blackish bloud; inso much that his companion being all wet with the bloud wakened him, being almost halfe dead; and with much ado, at length brought him home to Mantua againe; but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all quite freed from his Iaundise.</hi>

                        <hi>an Inne-keeper of Northamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, a fat and corpulent man, hauing now and then voyded some small quantitie of bloud with his vrine did, notwithstanding but little re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard the same; vntill such time as he fell into a totall suppression of v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine; the paine whereof made him cast forth such pitifull cries and complaints, that his sorrowfull neighbours did much commiserate his distressed estate. His wife no lesse perplexed then amazed, at this so sudden and vnexpected accident, at his desire sent to intreat my ayde and counsell in this his so great extremitie. Some halfe an houre or lesse after the administration of a diureticke drinke inwardly, and a Cataplasme outwardly applyed to his share, he filled almost a chamber pot with bloud, some small quantitie of vrine being mingled with the same: whereupon followed immediatly ease and alleuiation of all his former annoyance. The same night, about an houre after, he sent me a little wooden dish almost halfe full of gobbets of congealed and clot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted bloud, resembling the substance of the Liuerie selfe. The next morning againe he sent me an vrinall almost full of bloud voyded at the same place, no vrine to the iudgement of the eye at the first to be discerned mingled with the same I caused him bleed oftner then once,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:2594:144"/> besides other fit and conuenient remedies, as well in diet as otherwise; and yet this fluxe continued lesse or more for some few dayes after. In the space of one weeke he lost in all aboue a gallon of bloud. For pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uention I wished him, besides good diet (hard to be obserued by people of that profession) with corroboratiue and other medicines fit for that purpose, with speciall regard to the Liuer, not to neglect Phlehotomie, at least euery Spring and Fall, which he duely put in practise for the first yeare: and, for any thing I could euer heare, was litle or nothing troubled after that time with this infirmitie. After this he liued at least three yeares, and then dyed suddenly; of the cause whereof here to discourse, were besides my present purpose.</hi> Diuerse others haue now and then by me bene obserued, troubled with the like eua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuation, without any great hurt or hinderance to their health; whom to auoide prolixitie and tediousnesse, I here willingly passe by: onely one I will touch but in two words.</p>

And this did I my selfe obserue in a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine Monke of the order of the Carmes, and Spaniard by nation, of the coldest and driest constitution of body that euer I did yet know, who for the space of sixe whole yeares, during his abode here with vs, and that in perfect good health, made alwayes a blacke vrine: and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing yet further demanded of vs concerning the continuance of it, did confidently affirme vnto vs, that so had he done the whole course of his life. And why not? May not a blacke and melancholicke bloud, supplying the place of the haemorrhoides or piles, being expelled by v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine, dye the same with the aforesaid colour? As also the like excretion of vrine so colored hath bene obserued in one</hi> Tardanellus <hi>an Italian, who did all his life time (liuing notwithstanding in perfect health) continually voyd such an vrine.

                        </note> We must not vnadui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sedly and without any limitation, iump with the iudgement of <hi>Galen</hi> in condemning of blacke vrines. For howsoeuer he did neuer perhaps see any saued after the voyding of such an vrine, yet haue diuerse other of no small note and fame since his time seene and obserued the same: for the which cause it ought not so much to be condemned; nay not if thou wouldest euen tye thine assertion to acute diseases: yea though thou shouldest yet further suppose many other bad and dangerous signes to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curre with the same. For besides <hi>Rhases, Auicenna,</hi> and <hi>Actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arius, Hippocrates</hi> himselfe, in his epidemicall histories, did ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue, that some with such vrines did recouer. The vrine there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore may be often of that colour without any imminent dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to the patient, and that vpon the taking of any meate, drinke, or medicine, of a blacke colour, &amp; perhaps indued with a <hi>diureticall</hi> qualitie; concerning which there is a prettie storie in <hi>Actuarius.</hi> It proueth also often a criticall excretion in Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tane agues, in diseases of the <hi>spleene,</hi> as also in the suppression of womens menstruous fluxes, and of the Hemorrhoides or piles in both sexes. And yet moreouer according to the minde of <hi>Auicenna,</hi> it cureth sometimes feauers of long continuance, whether they take their denomination from the day or from the night. And yet further, in some infirmities of the kidneyes,<note place="margin">Nocturnae vel diurnae febres.</note> or yet a stone congealed in the bladder, the vrine sometimes presenteth it selfe in the foresaid habit and colour. And finally, it doth sometimes presage the happie issue and euent of feauers by bleeding at the nose or sweating. Since therefore sometimes it is a forerunner of extreme danger, to wit, when it doth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from extreme heat or cold, and sometimes againe secure and without any danger at all, <hi>Rhases</hi> and <hi>Auicenna</hi> do thus ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord them.

The same Author affirmeth, that blacke vrine after great trauell and exercise, doth prognosticate a conuulsion, and that a glister made of the decoction onely of high coloured red wine, hath produced a blacke vrine. And againe, out of <hi>Rufus Ephesius,</hi> who liued about the time of the Emperour <hi>Traian,</hi> that blacke vrine, voyded for a long time to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in the time of health, prognosticateth the ingendring of a stone in the kidneyes. But I proceed now to some other colours of vrines, which by our Authors are all referred to the former colour, and not much also disagreeing in signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication.</p>
                     <p>Blew vrines, called commonly <hi>veneta &amp; caerulea,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Of blew vrines.</note> being as it were a more remisse blacke, and not dyed with so great a quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titie of that humour, hath also diuerse significations. For being thicke withall, it signifieth that blacke choller, proceeding first from yellow choller very adust, doth colour the vrine: or else so great cold of the inward parts, that they are almost quite mortified. It signifieth moreouer, extraordinarie exercise of the bodie by running. In such as do recouer out of any disease, it is a signe of a laudable crise, especially if it come in any great quantitie: for by this meanes the adust parts are voyded foorth. In old men, if such an vrine persist long, it argueth that the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall constitution of the bladder is altered and changed by bad and corrupt humours. In such as are subiect to the stone, it is a signe of the approching of the Strangurie. The same vrine is also sometimes obserued to be thinne, then signifying the mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of melancholy, which doth but a little colour the vrine. And sometimes also it signifieth blowes and stripes, howbeit not in any violent or excessiue manner, and in such a case it is a laudable and good signe.</p>
                     <p>As concerning greene vrines,<note place="margin">Of greene v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rines.</note> of them our Physitians com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly make two sorts: one properly so called, and the other
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:2594:148"/> called greene oylie vrines. As for the first, it signifieth accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to our writers, abundance of choler adust, and of a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligne qualitie, and almost readie to be turned into blacke, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing daily more and more parched and burnt vp. And com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly in the best signification it signifieth adustion of the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, long continuance and perseuerance of the same. And sometimes cold in extreamest degree, as was said before of blacke, and then is mortall: especially if leaden colour and blacke follow successiuely at diuers times, pulse feeble, with thirst or short breath. Sometimes againe a Quotidian ague and yellow Iaundise, especially with an ague. And howbeit these vrines often proue dangerous, yet is not the case alwayes alike: for sometimes this colour may be also seene in sound &amp; health<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full bodies.<note place="margin">

                        <hi>There was a certaine Physitian, who hauing fed on some nourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of that colour, did afterwards voyd an vrine of the same colour, which he sent to another Physitian, to fish out his opinion concerning the same. This other Physitian gaue out his verdict concerning the great danger this vrine did threaten the owner. But the other sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding him backe word againe, that vpon the feeding on such and such food it was no vncouth thing for him to voyd such an vrine: and withall aduised him not to pronounce his opinion so peremptorily vpon the colour of the vrine onely.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">Of popiniay greene, oylie vrine.</note>The other sort of greene vrines is a light popiniay greene, called also an oylie vrine: that is, such whose substance is clam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie and thicke, as oyle or fat molten. It commonly signifieth colliquation, and wasting of the fat within man or woman, as proceeding from excessiue heate. And yet such vrines, if blacke vrines went before, signifieth health at hand. If it come sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly and in a short time, it argueth the colliquation or wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting of the kidneyes only. The higher this colour is, the worse they commonly hold it. But I will dwell no longer vpon this colour, since the vncertaintie thereof may be collected by that
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:2594:148"/> which hath bene said alreadie.</p>
                     <p>As for ash-coloured or leaden coloured vrines,<note place="margin">Of ash-colou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, or leaden coloured vrines.</note> they haue not alwayes one and the same signification more then the former. If an vrine of this colour be thicke, and greene coloured vrine went before, it signifieth extreame heate and burning: if pale coloured vrine went before, it doth portend extreame cold and mortification. This kind of vrine may also proceed from the affluxe of melancholicke humours, or else by reason of great blowes or stripes: and then it may prooue a good signe, the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulsiue power expelling such residence towards the bottome. In feauers an vrine of this colour without any setling or resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, is a signe of death. But in a burning feauer it doth por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend a Strangurie. The same causes which did produce blew vrines, do also bring foorth this colour, but that in this all things are more violent. Sometimes such an vrine is a signe of the blacke Iaundise proceeding from melancholy. But then it portends health, especially if it be voyded in any great quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titie and thicke in substance, by reason of the euacuation of such thicke humours. It is then apparent that these colours signifie not alwayes one certaine thing, but sometimes quite contrary. For the which cause it is no maruell if a Physitian who should settle his iudgement solely thereupon, might easily be deceiued.</p>

                        <note place="margin">Historie.</note>
                        <hi>About some eight or nine yeares ago, there came to me a yeoman of Northampton shire, bringing with him his vrine which well nigh filled the vrinall, being as cleare as any crystall, without any contents at all, except some few motes, such as they say are found in the vrines of women with child. And because I did see so great ods betwixt his complexion and his vrine (he being indifferent well coloured in regard of the vrine, howbeit neare fiftie yeares of age) not suspecting this
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:2594:149"/> vrine to be his owne, began to enquire some circumstances concerning the same, as namely the time of continuance. At length he freely and of his owne accord confessed, that the vrine was his owne, and that aboue the space of sixe yeares by-past his vrine had not altered nor changed from that I did now see it. He added moreouer, that he felt neither griefe nor trouble in his bodie, as being able to go about his ordinarie employments and workes of his calling; that he was now and then troubled with some wind in his stomach, and that he himselfe wondered not a little at the long continuance of his vrine after this manner. I gaue him directions against obstructions and crudities, with some things for the strengthening of his stomach, and neuer since heard any more newes of him.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The like vrine haue I often obserued in many other cases, and will instance but in one: to wit, an <hi>hystericall passion,</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly called the mother.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Some ten yeares ago I had in cure a young maid,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Another.</note>
                        <hi>much molested with that disease which is commonly called the Mother. For foure dayes together, from twelue of the clocke at noone till night, her fits were so violent and tedious, and the intermissions so short, that both her father and other friends tooke (as they thought) their last leaue of her. In her time of intermission, or rather remission, when she was most sensible of her selfe, she voyded almost a chamber pot full at a time of thinne cleare vrine, like vnto spring-water, without any manner of contents discernable to the sharpest eye-sight, and this commonly foure or fiue times in an afternoone, and that during the dayes of the foure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said fits. But being afterwards freed from this infirmitie, she was likewise freed from the aforementioned accident. Neither did I euer since that time know her troubled with this disease, saue once since she was married, and yet was nothing in regard of the former ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremitie.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If any <hi>Argus</hi> had bene there with his hundreth eyes, or yet the sharpe sighted <hi>Lynceus</hi> himselfe, where such vrines had bene brought in two seuerall vrinals (I meane the mans last mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and this womans) they had neuer bene able to discerne any difference betwixt these two vrines: much lesse then the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant Empiricke, the peticoate or woman-physitian, or the cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningest pisse-prophet among them all: and if thout wilt, put in
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:2594:150"/> master Parson-practiser to make better weight. And if any had brought such an vrine, so often, in so great quantity, to any Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitian, was there any reason why he should not rather haue con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iectured a <hi>Diabete,</hi> or <hi>pissing euill,</hi> then any other infirmitie?

                        <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> in the late alledged place, doth include very thicke vrines, of whatsoeuer colour they be, within the same de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of danger. And <hi>Galen</hi> himselfe seemeth to second this o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, auerring that the thicker an vrine is, the more danger hath he most commonly obserued in the same. <hi>Rondeletius</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmeth, that white vrines which are not transparent, but thicke almost like vnto milke, do signifie abundance of phlegme, and secondarily wormes, the falling-sicknesse, head-ach, palsie, conuulsions, great coldnesse of the naturall parts: and finally, all manner of diseases proceeding from phlegme. If such an v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine then were offered to thy view and consideration, good master vrine-monger, for which of these diseases wouldest thou giue out sentence? There being many moe phlegmaticke dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eases besides the last rehearsed; and many of them proceeding from other causes, must by consequent be accompanied with other vrines: yea and in the same cause the vrine may by diuers meanes not be the same. And these thicke vrines sometimes ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with a copious residence, and sometimes againe without the same. I will now proceed to some instances of both, where it shall appeare that sometimes some such vrines are not so dangerous as they are deemed.</p>

                        <hi>I did see in the Castle of Itrum in the Countie of Sundoz, a young man about thirtie yeares of age, who did euery day make an vrine in great abundance, wherein did settle a white residence, like vnto curd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led milke, filling the vrinall halfe full, howbeit aboue the same did swim a small quantitie of whitish vrine like vnto whey.

                        <hi>dwelling in the South suburbe of Northampton, commonly called Cottonend, sent me an vrine, if so it might be called, which was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing else, as one would haue iudged by the eye, but thicke curdled milke, which did very neare fill the vrinall, onely on the top of it did swim a little liquor like vnto white posset drinke, being not halfe an inch thicke aboue the foresaid contents. And howbeit I did twice or thrice see her vrine afterwards, yet could I neuer againe see these curdled contents, it being onely like the aforesaid white posset drinke, howbeit she had sometimes before voyded such an vrine, as I was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed. She died about two moneths after: and as it seemeth, of a consumption and wasting of the kidneyes and other vrinary passages, as by some signes did appeare. And what if the spermaticall parts did participate with the former? The woman had lyen long languishing, neither was I euer called to see her, and for any thing I know, had few or no meanes administred vnto her, being but of poore and meane estate.</hi>

                        <hi>An ancient Gentleman and acquaintance of mine dwelling in Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, being at least threescore and ten yeares of age, at that time</hi> 1611. <hi>had for a long time voyded great store of such tough phlegmaticke matter, most like vnto birdlime or gellie, and on the top of the same some vrine was to be seene of a darke colour, not vnlike to transparent horne. His paine was exceeding great, prouoking him almost euery minute of an houre to this vntimely excretion of his vrine. The coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels of the best Physitians were not wanting, some being of opinion it was a stone in the bladder, others iudging otherwise. My opinion being demanded, I told him I was not of their opinion, who held that there was a stone in the bladder, moued hereunto by some probable coniectares. But seeing him much macerated and weakened by much Physicke, exhibited both by the learned Physitian, and by the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant Empiricke also, my aduice was, that he should abstaine from all manner of laxatiue medicines, except it were now and then some gentle glister or lenitiue to procure the benefit of nature. I appointed him also fit and conuenient diet: and all his Physicke was nothing saue some certaine Emulsions, as also some Iuleps composed of some syrupes and distilled waters, most proper and conuenient for his disease, and that not for a weeke or a moneth, but for three or foure moneths to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. After two moneths were past he found sensible ease and alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiation, but yet much more the next Spring, this being towards the
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:2594:151"/> beginning of Winter: and hath since that time scarce euer complained at all of this so tedious and tormenting infirmitie. And this last Spring his strength spent, and the oyle in the lampe failing, being full of dayes, payed that debt which admitteth no baile nor suretiship.</hi> This then may appeare that the vrine here could giue vs no assured know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the certaintie of the disease, whether the Stone or strangurie. And thus the vncertaintie of this colour, as well as of the rest, cannot be concealed from the iudicious and vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing Reader: whose patience I must yet intreat to giue eare to some things yet to be said concerning the contents of vrine: concerning the which, howbeit here and there, and namely in this last colour, something hath bene said, yet was not this my principall purpose and intent; but is as it were thrust in by head and shoulders. Now shall something be said of set purpose, whereas I will forbeare to repeate any thing which hath bene said alreadie.</p>

Hence haue we the proportion betwixt the regions of the bodie of man, and the regions of the vrine violently thrust vpon vs; and as they will haue the other parts of the vrine answerable to the rest of the parts of the body; so must the crowne or garland answer proportionably to the head, or some part of it at least. And not with this content, they ascribe seueral colours of these circles, not to seuerall humours onely, but to seuerall parts of the head also; sometimes to the right, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to the left: and againe sometimes to the hinder part, and sometimes to the fore part; diuing sometimes into the verie ventricles or inward concauities thereof. And yet to discerne these circles or garlands aright, a sharpe and very quicke sight is very requisite. Moreouer, may not thine owne sight, together with the qualitie or quantitie of the light, the diuers manners of situation of the vrinall, one or all of these, easily alter the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of this thy circle, making it appeare sometimes of one, sometimes of another colour? Besides, these circles or garlands are supposed to be seene in such vrines onely as are not of one
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:2594:152"/> colour, and the ouermost part thinner then the other. On the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall significations of the supposed seuerall colours thereof, with their proportions to the humours of the head, if I should particularly insist, and confute them, as some might perhaps ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, I thinke it would prooue but a needlesse and superfluous labour, the thing being so idle in it selfe, and of so small ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count.

The like may I say concerning the crownes or garlands in vrines, the opinion whereof hath now almost so deeply possessed euery mans mind. It is most certaine that Actuarius himselfe neuer did prognosticate any such thing by this circle or line compassing round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the ouermost part of the vrine, hauing onely brought it in, to the end he might prognosticate by the bubbles when as they do appeare in it.

For who seeth not, that as well the spume as the bubbles stay longer in the crowne or garland of the vrine, and in the middle part of the su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perficies or ouermost part they are sooner dissolued. For the case is not here alike as in the garland, where the solid body of the vrinall is an occasion that they sticke longer and more firmely to the same. And this not in vrine onely, but in any other liquor in like manner may easily be obserued, to wit, that such froth and bubbles do longer per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist in the circle ioyning to the vessell then in the rest of the ouermost part of the same, &amp;c.</hi> This foundation then being rotten, the rest of the building must needs fall to the ground. They tell vs in the first place that bubbles which stand round about ouer the garland onely, and continue without parting, if they be of the same colour the vrine is of, they declare that there is great paine in all the parts of the head. But if they occupie onely the one halfe of the garland, then is that paine in one halfe of the head. But I assure thee, such bubbles may be seene, and thou not able to discerne whether the wind be in the head or taile. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides thou mayest sometimes finde a good fellow who could quickly fill a baggepipe with his bum, and yet in his vrine see
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:2594:153"/> neither bubble nor any other such babble.<note place="margin">See before in the beginning.</note> But concerning the vncertaintie of these things, something hath bene said alreadie in another place, whereas mention was made of the regions of the vrine answering to the parts of mans body, which was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued most false. It is granted, that sometimes these bubbles do not appeare at the first in the beginning of the disease, howbeit after a while they begin to shew themselues: and then is it an argument that nature waxeth strong to concoct and ouercome the bad humours. In feauers therefore such do signifie the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining or decaying of the same. But if they haue bene from the beginning still so continuing, then is the danger greater, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit better with a thicke then with a thinne vrine. Now put the case that in an vrine brought to thee from afarre thou mightest discerne some such bubble or froth, yet how shalt thou be able to discerne whether any were in the vrine at the beginning of the disease, or no? The messenger for the most part can tell thee no more then the ground he goeth on: and it may be, that neither the patient nor any about him are able to obserue such nice curiosities, as often not obseruing matters of greater mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. But put yet the case thou couldst discerne some headach by the aforesaid contents, how shalt thou euer be able to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne whether it come, as we say, <hi>per sympathiam,</hi> by consent from the neather parts (which is most common) or <hi>per idiepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiam:</hi> that is, be primarily seated in the head? And if thou knowest not this, thy knowledge is to small purpose, the cure differing according to the seuerall causes. Of this the patient will giue thee better satisfaction then a thousand vrines. <hi>If bub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles do appeare in the vrine (saith</hi> Reusner) <hi>together with the signes of defluxion or distillation of humours,</hi>

These fat vrines also signifie sometimes a wasting of the whole bodie, if there be

                        </note> But this is yet worth the obseruing (saith <hi>Roganus</hi>) that when as these wasting or consuming feauers haue wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nigh wasted away the whole bodie, then are no more such wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting excretions, which he calleth <hi>syntectica excrementa,</hi> either fat vrines or faecall excrements to be seene.

The truth of this assertion may also in this more plainly appeare, that many haue dyed of such consumption and wasting, who neuer, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding had any fat swimme on their vrines. Sometimes it hath bene also obserued, that the vessell wherein the vrine hath bene car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed to the Physitian, hath before contained either oyle or some other

                        <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N the first place we are to obserue, that all vrines are not accompanied with contents,<note place="margin">All vrines are not accompani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents.</note> but many depriued of them; which may proceed from di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerse causes. As namely, in case of cruditie, and the concoction being good, yet may some ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction hinder any contents to passe.<note place="margin">And may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers causes.</note> The like may be by fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting procured, and want of food, which may also make the vrine of an higher colour. The inflammation of any part of the
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:2594:155"/> bodie, by drawing of the humours thither, may produce the like effect. In lasks also or fluxes of the bellie, as the vrine shall be the lesser, so shall the contents be few or none at all. Some certaine constitutions also gather no setlings in their vrines: and such as are in present health, and eate much, haue a more copious residence, and in Winter it doth more abound then in Sommer. Laborious and very painfull people may also haue lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle or no contents at all in their vrines. The time of the sicknesse in which this cometh to passe, is also narrowly to be obserued: for in the beginning and increase of acute diseases, then this want of contents argueth great defect of naturall strength and vigour. In the declining of the disease it is not a messenger of so bad newes, yea although it were in the vigour and strength of it. And moreouer that many diseases are brought to a hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie and expected issue without any contents at all, is no vncouth thing. What certaintie then can be collected, either by the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence or yet by the absence of the contents? Now howbeit heretofore some contents on the top of the vrine haue bene mentioned, yet are these last mentioned, most commonly and constantly to be seene ordinarily in vrines; and therefore are more properly called contents, and so to be vnderstood by that name. Now all these three, cloud, swimme, and grounds, haue one and the same materiall cause, and their generation is also alike, differing onely in place and situation, according to the weight of the matter and the concoction of the disease. When the disease is yet crude and not concocted, yet in some for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardnesse thereunto, then appeareth that which is commonly called a cloud,<note place="margin">The cloud.</note> for the proportion and analogie it seemeth to haue with the clouds of the aire. When the disease is yet in a better forwardnesse, then is to be seene in the vrine, that which is commonly called the swim<note place="margin">The swimme.</note> or sublimation, hanging as it were betwixt the ouermost and neathermost region of the v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine. But when nature hath now gotten the vpper hand of the disease, then doth this which we call ground,<note place="margin">The ground.</note> settle to the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome of the vrinall. My purpose is not here to enter into a large discourse concerning the engendring of this substance, and farre lesse yet the controuersies about the same, which I leaue
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:2594:156"/> to be discussed in the schooles, my intent here being onely to discouer the vncertaintie of iudgement which these contents do affoord vs. Now when thou seest the cloud, swim, or resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, what canst thou pronounce but some generall and inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite verdict concerning the cruditie or concoction of the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease? but what this thy disease is, thy vrine will neuer reueale vnto thee, nor any of the rest of the signes and circumstances to be obserued in diseases. And howsoeuer the materiall cause of all these three be one and the same, differing onely in cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances, yet may sometimes the one be without the other. <hi>Whersoeuer there is a swim (saith</hi> Scribonius) <hi>there is also a ground or residence,</hi>

                        <hi>which may also be vnderstood of a cloud: howbeit the ground may be without the former: to wit, if it do not containe such a flatuous matter as raiseth the same vp, according to the testimonie of</hi> Galen. <hi>Moreouer, the best and most healthfull vrine is accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted such as hath no such cloud nor swim in it, as witnesseth the same</hi> Galen.<note place="margin">2. <hi>Prorrh.</hi> 1. <hi>&amp;</hi> 2. <hi>in</hi> 6. <hi>epid.</hi> 37.</note>
                        <hi>And moreouer, if they be present, the iudgement by them is yet vncertaine.

<pb n="99" facs="tcp:2594:156"/> or contents in the vrine, must likewise be said, that the errours and impostures in this point, as well as in other parts of the vrine, may be layd open to the capacitie of the most ignorant.</p>
                     <p>As in the colours, therefore so in the contents, we will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin with the best of all others. That then is accounted the best sediment, setling, or ground, which is white, duly knit and sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and that continually all the time of the sicknesse: and that which declineth from the foresaid laudable conditions, is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted worse, and that so much the more as it doth decline from them. It is generally agreed vpon among Physitians, that great store of yellow grounds argueth great store of yellow choler in the bodie; and the lighter coloured it be, it argueth the lesse, the higher coloured the greater excesse. Now besides that thou canst not tell what particular disease proceeding from choler (there being diuers) it may signifie, as whether an Ague, or some other disease: and againe, if an Ague, of what sort or kind, continuall or intermittent: so much lesse art thou able to tell the time of it, which notwithstanding maketh not a little to informe thy iudgement concerning the vrine. For if at the first there be either small quantitie of choler, or yet none at all, and then it after increase abundantly, which is knowne by changing from a white thin to a saffron coloured ground) it is a signe and token that nature doth vnburden it selfe of this heauie ballast of choler, and so consequently that health is like shortly to ensue. But if after a saffron colour it change to a white, it is a bad signe, especially without signes of concoction: for the which cause it will be requisite that thou obserue the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall alterations of the vrine, and then be well acquainted with the state and nature of the disease of the patient. The like may be said of red residence,<note place="margin">Red residence.</note> the which in the beginning of diseases doth not portend any good, and that by reason it argueth great store of cruditie, which hindereth the concoction of the bloud; and such are commonly seene in bastard Tertian &amp; Quotidian Agues. But yet such Feuers as are incident to Plethoricall and Catechymicall constitutions, oppressed with abundance of bloud and bad humors, if they attaine to their expected issue, must needs be accompanied with such or the like residence.
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:2594:157"/> The bare inspection of the vrine onely will neuer acquaint thee with the particular. Sometimes both the afore-mentioned contents are to be seene in one and the same vrine, which is sometimes deadly, and sometimes againe proueth a fore-runner of safetie and securitie: I will instance in two examples of mine owne experience, to make the truth of this appeare.</p>

For besides her being with a liue child (for vntill that time was not my counsell craued) she was for a many weekes together neuer free from a Tertian, Quotidian, or both agues conioyned: the which were accompanied with a continuall cough, proceeding from a thinne salt rheume, with spitting of bloud, reaching and casting, as also a great laske, all which accidents, or the most of them, did not forsake her till neare the time of her deliuerie. Phlebotomie for diuerse considerations I durst not then attempt. Other euacuations, both vpwards and downewards, came in greater abundance then was wished. It was now deepely imprinted, not in her owne onely, but in the conceits of her neighbours and others also of good vnderstanding, that (in regard of her spitting of bloud) she was now farre spent in an irrecouerable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption.

It hath beene likewise already related, that sometimes great quantitie of bloud it selfe hath beene voyded without any danger: and sometimes againe af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the voyding of a very small quantitie thereof, death hath not long deferred his approaches.</p>

                        <hi>my counsell was demanded for a Gentleman dwelling neare</hi> Northampton, <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout fiftie yeares of age or vpwards.

And howbeit I often earnestly intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him to admit of Phlebotomie, as the onely remedy to preuent a greater inconuenience, yet could I not preuaile, vntill such time as bloud now issuing out in great abundance, both vpwards and downe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, his strength now decaying, and hairy irrecouerable occasion ouer past, with a too late repentance, he would willingly haue paied a good fine for the renewing of the lease of his life, but all too late.</hi>

As for the first, the action is interessed three manner of wayes, as witnesseth <hi>Hollerius</hi> and others. First, there is a great desire to pisse, but cannot be effected without force and hard straining, &amp; sometimes not without paine.

Seuenthly, by the consent of the places adioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, the bladder and the vrine-pipes are sometimes so shut vp, that they cannot freely deliuer the vrine, which cometh often to passe in women, by reason of the nearenesse of the wombe.

A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, if there be a retention of the vrine, what wilt thou send to the Physitian? And if such an accident come to the cure of some Empiricke or vnskilfull Physitian, his conceit will straightway leade him to some stone, and so, according to their ignorance in this art, exhibite strong diuretickes, or medicines prouoking vrine, as I haue sometimes obserued:<note n="*" place="margin">Calculus renum rare aut nun. quam diuretica huius aut illius sortis citra dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num admittit, &amp;c.</note> which are so farre from procuring the intended good, that they produce ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a contrary effect.

                        <hi>of good worth, trauailing towards London thorow this Towne of Northamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, was suddenly surprised with a suppression of vrine. Being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid of a stone in his bladder (howbeit he had neuer heretofore complained of this infirmity) yet tried he what the art of Surgerie could doe, by meanes of a Catheter thrust vp thorow his yard to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the necke of his bladder, together with some other meanes, which notwithstanding tooke no effect. The next morning, about eight of the clocke, I was sent for to the patient, whose belly began to swell, and some fumes to ascend into his head. By meanes of a gentle opening iulep, together with a Cataplasme applied to his share, it pleased God to accomplish his desires: howbeit a messenger had bene already sent away to bring with him an expert Surgeon to make in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision. He voyded that day abundance of vrine of a laudable colour, and answerable contents, so that none could find any fault in the same, and the next day he went forward in his intended iourney towards London.</hi>

                     <p>The passage of the vrine in this patient was somewhat nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, as seemeth, and that by reason of some former infirmity; and perhaps some wind gathered in the great gut might make some compression of the necke of the bladder.

                           </gap>gining it to be some cold, continued ill that night, and the next day and night following. The Satterday after, and the
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:2594:162"/> third day of his disease, by perswasion of some of his friends, his vrine with a letter was carried to a Parson-practiser, dwelling about a dozen of miles hence, one of our chiefe Calculators of Natiuities in all the countrey. The Parson sent backe word, it was a blind Ague, and withall sends him a vomit, and prescribes Phlebotomie. The Surgeon being sent for, perceiues a Iaundise, and the patient com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaines of some faintnesse; vpon which occasion he refuses to let him bloud, wishing his friends to acquaint the Parson with these occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents. The Parson repeales his former sentence, and commends the Surgeon for being so sparing. And indeed he dealt honestlier then the Parson: for he trusted none but his owne eyes, and so told his mind freely to his friend: but the Parson both saw with other mens eyes, and heard with other mens eares; and building vpon this sandy foundation, sent his Oracle to the absent, which he as easily recalled againe vpon the first information, and sends him another Oracle written now in a peece of paper, and withall sends him an Electuary and Iulep for his laundise, and some directions for a drinke. But let vs heare the laudable effects of this vomit. It wrought vpwards effectually, and something downewards: and while the patient was able to take any sustenance, it returned backe by the same way it went in. And besides, after the operation of this vomit, the Iaundise appeared, a suppression of vrine and ordure, together with a troublesome and tedious Hicket, which neither day nor night forsooke our patient. To the former accidents was shortly added a difficulty in swallowing, with an extreame sorenesse in his mouth, which like a Canker spread it selfe ouer all the parts of the same, with an vlcer (as appeared) in the Almonds or parts adioyning, which yeelded such abundance of white corrupted matter at first, and afterwards coloured, as I neuer did obserue the like in euery re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect. The Parson being earnestly intreated to affoord his patient his presence in this his so great extremity, no prayers would preuaile; but sent him backe word, that the Iaundise now appearing, he hoped the worst was past. The patient seeing himselfe forsaken now in his greatest need, hauing learned by a too late repentance, that his Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son proued not so trusty a friend as he supposed;</hi> Cum nemini ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trudi potest itur ad me. <hi>On the Thursday after, about two a clocke in the morning, and the beginning of the eight day since the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning

But the pulse played not his part so well as I wished, and the sorenesse of his mouth increased so fast, that it began to get ground vpon his lips. The which I then perceiuing, as likewise that he was not as yet free from his Feauer, willing to trie if Phlebotomie would any thing auaile, I gaue way to the vsing of this remedie. About sixe ounces of very corrupt bloud were taken from him on Saturday morning, (his nose hauing made some offer twice or thrice before, and once after his Phleboto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie) not without alleuiation, whereupon ensued reasonable good rest the night following. On Sonday morning was little alteration to be discerned, but that he complained much of faintnesse, and yet was bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter able to swallow then before: the sorenesse of his mouth began like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise to amend, being duly dressed diuerse times of the day: his hicket also was no more to be heard. Not full two houres after our departure, Death sends him new summons by some change and alteration to the worse, which could not be concealed from the most vulgar eye. In the afternoone visiting him, I found no further hope or encouragement to proceed, and yet farre lesse on Monday morning, saue that I wished them still to continue the giuing of him a Cordiall Iulep there in a readinesse, and so left visiting him any more, and he ere nine of the clocke at night, obeying Deaths last summons, discharged that debt which we haue yet to pay.</hi>

                     <p>But now Master Parson, our patient resting in peace, I would willingly expostulate a little concerning your carelesse (and as I
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:2594:163"/> thinke) irregular and ignorant proceeding in this businesse, which concerned no lesse then a mans life: the life, I say, not of an ordinary man, but of a magistrate, whom this corporation could not so well at this time haue spared; besides the interest his wife and children and other friends had in him. In the first place your Oracle being asked, it answered, His disease was a blind Ague.<note place="margin">Raro aut nun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam eisdem accidentibus &amp; conditionibus in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signata apparet huiusmodi febris, sed pro varietate corporei appara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus &amp; aliarum rerum, quae cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus humanam mutare habent, variari subinde ipsam contingit.

                        </note> Of maligne Feauers I haue both read, and knowne them possesse now and then some of my patients; but as for blind Agues, we leaue them to Parsons that cannot see. And what be the <hi>Pathognomonicke</hi> signes of a blind Ague, and what Authors write of it? The vrine told you no such matter, and I dare say, the messenger was much amazed at so blind an Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle. But this is no new practise of your selfe and others of your cloth, lest you should seem to be ignorant of any thing, to coyne new names for diseases, whereof you are altogether ignorant. And thus another of your double profession, some few yeares ago, his iudgement by a Gentleman concerning his disease be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing demanded, answered, It was a disease in his spirits. The Gentleman died within a few dayes after of a Feauer, which tooke possession of the whole bodie; and a Physitian that came afterwards to him, thought it to be a Squinancie, and that the Parson had wronged him in deferring Phlebotomie too long, by the which he gaue the patient some ease for the present. If this Parson had euer learned the grounds of Physicke, he could haue told that that Feauer which we call <hi>Ephemera,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Gal. <hi>1.</hi> de differ. febr. cap. <hi>1.</hi>

But what remedies were by you appointed for this patients blind Ague, as it pleaseth you to call it? If a blind Ague, it had as blind a remedie, a vomit was exhibited, Phle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>botomie prescribed. As for your vomit, although I neuer did see it, yet I am not ignorant of the matter and nature of it. But be what it would, that it was then vnseasonable, I thinke any of common sense cannot deny. For in the first place he had not long bene sicke, neither yet came his sicknesse by any surfet, to induce you at first dash to prescribe him such a vomit before
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:2594:163"/> any other remedie. Againe, you ought not to be ignorant, that in most diseases (acute especially) the appetite faileth at first, and yet vse we not alwayes to begin with strong stibiate vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits. But what were the effects of your vomit we haue heard, and the patient fared the worse for it. He was subiect to an old paine in his head, and with this vnseasonable vomit the torrent of those sharpe and maligne cholericke humours wherewith his bodie abounded, were drawne vp towards the throate, and other parts adioyning: hence had he that exulceration in his throate and mouth, the hicket, &amp;c. I know your grauitie would disdaine the name of an Empiricke, but pardon me good master Parson, this course was too Empiricall, I wish both your selfe and some of your brethren to be more circumspect in exhibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting your vomits. It is too well knowne in the countrey,<note place="margin">Strong stibiate vomits ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily vsed by our Parson-practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sers in most dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eases, and for the most part with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the sight of their patient.</note> that strong stibiate vomits are vsed by many of you, almost in euery disease, as some famous <hi>Panacaea</hi> or <hi>Aurum Potabile,</hi> falsly sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed good against all diseases. The other Parson lately men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, within these few yeares gaue two vomits in one day, the one to a woman dwelling seauen miles off this towne, who died presently: the other to a woman of this towne of good ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, and since my patient, at that time being big with child, and the vomit wrought with great violence from seauen a clocke in the morning till foure a clocke in the afternoone, and hardly escaped she the like danger, or abortion at least.</p>

I denie not the necessitie thereof, howsoeuer your prescription was but by ayme, as being ignorant of his strength, wherein the messenger might easily be mistaken, as it often cometh to passe. Within these two yeares past, I tooke aboue fiftie ounces of bloud from a man of middle age in this same towne, being seised with a burning Feauer, accompanied with a strong de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liration, whom his friends supposed to be so weake, that after I had seene him, &amp; acquainted them with the truth, scarce could I perswade them to yeeld to this remedie. And this was perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in a weekes space, the patient taking nothing in the meane while but a little drinke, or milke and water, being both then and a long time after depriued of his naturall rest, by his owne vnrulinesse, and his friends carelesnesse, and yet recouered he his health.

And as for some faintnesse, it is not vnusuall in this disease, where there is neither Feauer nor danger of death. The vomit was a great deale worse then the opening of a veine.

                        <hi>Reusner</hi> speake. After the separation of the aforesaid Elements (saith he) the vapors ascending sticke to some part of the Still, answering in situation to that part of the body of man in the which lyeth hid the very foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine and spring of the disease, and doth withall so plainly and
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:2594:167"/> clearely represent vnto vs, both the kind and the nature of the disease, that it may easily appeare to what element and princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall part it is to be referred.

If we shall narrowly pry into this point, I doubt we shall find the old Prouerbe true, <hi>Out of the frying pan into the fire.</hi> But heare the cōfutation out of the mouth of a lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Physitian, often quoted in this Discourse. This doctrine of <hi>Thurnheusers</hi> (saith<note n="*" place="margin">Guil. Adolph. Scribon. de in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect. vrin. sub finem.</note> he) cannot by any sound argument be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrated. For admit that the vrine be separated into seue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall elements, according to the seuerall parts thereof, yet can nothing but the elementarie qualities (as they call them) heat, cold, &amp;c. be discerned by the same. And by this meanes shall we onely be able to iudge of the diseases of the solid parts; as of obstructions, exulcerations, and the like. And is not the vrine an excrement of the bloud contained in the veines, that is of one body? What vtilitie or profit therefore can come by this separation into seuerall parts? Thou shalt thus onely ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue the number of the parts which are in the substance of the bloud, and of what nature and kind it is. Thou mayest per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps perceiue it either to bee caused of Mercurie, Sulphur, or Salt. But wilt thou straight-waies maintaine, that all Mercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall diseases are seated in the head onely? &amp;c. If this bee true, then will it follow, contrary to that which thou and <hi>Paracelsus</hi> maintaine, that these three grounds or elements are not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to all diseases. For I am of opinion, that if we will needs vse the names of these three; as well such diseases as haue their originall from this Sulphureous and salt matter, as any that proceed from a Mercuriall cause, haue their root and originall from the head,<note place="margin">Absurditie of this opinion.</note> &amp;c. Thus farre our Author. And may not this opinion seeme so absurd in it selfe, that it needeth no further confutation? For if when thou hadst vsed all thy art and cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, a countrey-man should aske thine opinion concerning his vrine, and thou shouldst tell him hee were troubled with some sulphureous, Mercuriall, or saltish and tartareous disease, would he not laugh thee to scorne, and thinke, it may be, thou hadst beene that day too well acquainted with some pots and
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:2594:167"/> pipes of Tobacco? And if hee should desire to know what were his particular disease, and where or what particular part of the body it had taken vp for its abode; would it seeme strange if he looked for some extraordinary skill after so great an outward oftentation? And if he should go home and tell his wife of a Tartareous, Sulphureous, or Mercuriall disease, who knowes but she might call him Good-man Wood cocke for telling her such a tale of <hi>Robin-hood?</hi> But put the case thou mightest yet see some Sulphureous disease (as they terme it) by meanes of this separation and distillation; yet amongst ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny such Sulphureous diseases, vpon which of them wouldst thou fasten thy coniecture? As if a Feauer might be found out, how may the kind be knowne, whether a continuall or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittent; and whether symptomaticall or dependant vpon some other disease; or else be it selfe a principall guest, with many moe circumstances? The like may be said of the other two principles. So that it may euidently appeare, there is greater vncertaintie in this then the other way. But if they will be so skilfoole, I wish they would distill the other excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment also; for I am sure they may learne of both alike. But yet wish I them to take this <hi>Prouiso</hi> with them, that the ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings of their stils and Alembicks be well luted with <hi>lutum moschatum,</hi> or <hi>ambarinum,</hi> that none of this fragrant smell be carried away with the wind, and so some part of this precious liquor lost. But it may be, when the patient had cast vp his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, he would find this manner of casting of waters, as they terme it, more costly then the ordinary. But for my part, I wish our vrine-mongers would vse it: for by this meanes this great abuse might the better be suppressed. But this opinion being so absurd in it selfe, needeth no further confutation. But fearing some infection, or at least annoyance to my nose by such Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curiall and Sulphureous smels, I thinke it is more then time to withdraw my selfe out of so stinking a place.

                        <hi>CHAP. XI.</hi> The Conclusion of this whole Discourse, where something concerning issue and euent, and casuall cures.</head>
                     <p>
                        <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Y the premisses then, I hope, doth plainly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare the absurditie of this erroneous and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueterate opinion of magnifying the vrine, and the iudgement concerning diseases which may from hence be collected. And therefore I hope the iudicious and vnpartiall Reader will with me subscribe to the generall conclusion; to wit, that there is no certaintie or assurance to be collected for the information of the iudgement, either concerning the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease it selfe, together with the particular symptomes and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall circumstances; and yet farre lesse for the cure of the same, by the bare inspection of the vrine onely. And therefore I cannot see any iust cause why it should not bee pronounced guiltie of man-slaughter at the least, if not of murther; and therefore is not a thing so slightly to be passed ouer, as many may idlely imagine.<note place="margin" type="runSum">Obiection.</note> But me thinkes I heare some of the vulgar sort, who thinke it a prettie thing to heare one prate ouer an vrine, obiect, That our censure seemeth too sharpe, since that daily experience doth not deny, that some haue from the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spection of the vrine, often attained to the knowledge of that they desired.<note place="margin" type="runSum">Answer.</note> Now as I denie not, but that sometimes one may through hap (as we say) hit the naile on the head: so on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther part, that this manner of casuall coniecture hath euer bene allowed of by the learned and more iudicious, I do vtterly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie. If Christians would hold their peace, yet will the heathen pleade on my side.<note place="margin">Careat successi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus opto quisquis ab euentu facta notanda putat. Ouid. in epist.</note> The Poet wished them a bad successe, who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer iudged of an action according to the issue or euent. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, that it is often a fallacie, a <hi>non causa pro causa,</hi> making the ignorant beleeue, they see that in or by an vrine, which neuer had allowance of any learned authoritie. And may not any ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant Empiricke, a cozening Quacksaluer, or any old woman, now and then guesse aright at an vrine, and by cunning inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatories
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:2594:168"/> and some other shifts, learne of the vnwarie messen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, as well the substance as the circumstances of the disease, at least as farre as they are able to relate? And this to be true, hath bene sufficiently prooued alreadie. Besides, that oftentimes the messenger himselfe cannot sufficiently informe the Physitian concerning the particular circumstances of the disease: and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, his owne ocular inspection often bringeth that to the eyes of his vnderstanding, which neither the messenger nor yet the patient himselfe were euer able to relate, and farre lesse the vrine make knowne. What hast thou then gained, when one of these vnsufficient persons hath told thee some truth by the vrine? To wit, that then thy conceit carrieth thee (howbeit most erroniously and falsly) to apprehend some extraordinarie sufficiencie in that person, as being best able to free thee from thine infirmitie. Thus then we see, <hi>Ʋno dato absurdo multa se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quuntur:</hi> One errour draweth on another. The prospe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

The diuell himselfe no doubt, as well in the ancient Oracles as of later dayes, hath sometimes told truth. I should be too tedious to instance in examples.

                        <hi>That at their owne cost and char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges they maintained many sufficient and skilfull Physitians: and moreouer, set downe an inuiolable law and ordinance, That if any Physitian following the precepts and rules of art, recorded in the bookes of the learned in that profession, yet could not attaine to the height of his hopes; the Patient through the violence of the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease yeelding to fatall necessitie, he was then freed from all danger of law. On the other part, if he recouered his Patient, yet neglecting the aforesaid rules and meanes, his punishment was no lesse then the losse of his life. What if</hi> (saith mine Author) <hi>this wholesome law were brought in amongst vs (as it were good reason it should) where could we find so many executioners condignely to punish such Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors, Empiricks, Women-Physitians, busie-bodies, &amp;c.</hi> Thus farre our Author. Now as concerning such remedies thus casually and vnskilfully <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>dministred, howsoeuer at sometimes they may either doe, or at least seeme to doe some good, which I will not deny: yet I am sure they do often more hurt then good; &amp; more hurt then on the sudden is perceiued, many often praising them for the Authors of their health, who haue bene the instruments of their vtter ouerthrow &amp; ruine: for howbeit the Patient reape some present ease, yet is his body by meanes of such medicines vnskilfully exhibited, left more infirme, and becommeth after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards more crasie: their cure being imperfect, accidentall, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certaine, and voyd of rule and reason. And howbeit I could make this small Tractate swell vp into a big and voluminous booke, if I should instance in a many of these casuall cures, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:2594:169"/> by Empiricks, and such others, which for feare of te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diousnesse and prolixitie I am loth to go about: yet before I make an end, I will offer to the Readers view, two or three Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries. During my abode at Paris, one Master <hi>Robin,</hi> ouer-seer of the Garden of Simples, related vnto me this which follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth. <hi>A few yeares agoe (saith he) the plague of Pestilence preuai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling daily more and more in this famous Cittie of Paris,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Historie.</note>
                        <hi>whereof no small numbers, especially of the meaner sort, died daily: the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Physitians did their best endeuours when their counsell was cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, and the ignorant Empiricks also were not idle. Amongst the rest was a certaine countrey Clowne carried on the wings of Fame, for his extraordinarie supposed skill in curing this disease, who was said to haue cured more then some of the most expert Physitians. The Duchesse of</hi> Longueuille <hi>being acquainted with these occurrents, sendeth for her Physitian, desirous to know the cause of so happie suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesses by so meane a person performed: which howbeit alwayes aymed at, yet are not alwayes attained vnto by men of greater merit. The Physitian well knowing the insufficiencie of this fellow, yet not fully ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the particulars and withall knowing how much is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly attributed to these casuall euents, answered onely in generall at that instant, that many things seeme often otherwise then they are indeed: and false fame maketh some men famous, whose names de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue rather to be buried in obliuion: and after some further dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course concerning that subiect (all which notwithstanding, would not satisfie her more then nice curiositie) he taketh his leaue for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent. A few dayes after, causing carefully to watch and obserue the actions of this Aesculapius, he was obserued to go to a certaine place within two little leagues of Paris, called</hi> Bois de Vincennes, <hi>that is,</hi> Vincence wood, <hi>and there to dig vp certaine rootes. The Physitian therewith acquainted, resorteth thither with speed, and finds that it was nothing else but a certaine kind of Spurge (whereof there grew in that place and about no small store) whereof this Clowne had at seuerall times digged vp great store, easily discerned by the holes there round about that place, some being but new digged. After a narrow search, he found that most of those whom this new Aesculapius was said to haue cured, either died after a certaine time of a bloudie Fluxe, this violent medicine hauing procured an excoriation in their
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:2594:170"/> guts, being especially exhibited without any preparation of the ill qualitie, or obseruation of the due dose or quantitie: or else that they liued a languishing life, worse then a speedie dispatch by a sudden death, from whose mercilesse clawes notwithstanding this former Purgatorie was not able to free some of them. The Physitian repai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring againe to the Duchesse, acquainteth her Grace with these seue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall circumstances: as also that it seemed most of those people were able, strong, and cacochymicall bodies, who would preferre the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell of this Clowne, before that of the learned and indicious Physitian.</hi> The issue notwithstanding did make it appeare, that if any did recouer, it came not to passe through his skill or sufficiencie, which as seemeth, was none at all, but by the strength of nature, able to expell both the Plague and the poyson of the medicine. The learned and iudicious Physitians againe met for the most part with thin and tender bodies, brought vp in ease and idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and for this cause aptest to receiue the poysoned impres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions of the pestilentiall aire, and therefore the disease prouing greater then the meanes were able to ouercome, the patients were often forced to faint vnder the burthen. Neither were such dangerous, or rather desperate meanes, as this Empiricke vsed, in their opinions to be administred to any, much lesse to persons of qualitie and weake constitution. The Noble woman hauing heard the Physitians apologie, was afterwards better pleased with her Physitian, and after that time conceiued a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter opinion. both of the Art and the professors of the same. I was likewise informed during my abode at Leua in Germanie,<note place="margin">Dangerous me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines exhibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by Paracel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists.</note> of many rare cures seemed to be performed by that medicine which they call the <hi>Philosophers stone, Aurum potabile,</hi> and many other such hyperbolicall medicines, exhibited by the Paracel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists of those parts. And yet most of them to whom they were exhibited, before the full period of a twelue moneth, went to visite their friends in another world: and little better successe for the most part had their maister <hi>Paracelsus</hi> himselfe.</p>

                        <hi>Some few yeares before my coming to this towne of</hi> Northampton, <hi>a certaine Empiricke, and Irish by nation, was accounted one of the most famous vrine-mongers in all the countrey about, but especially in telling whether women were with child or no. And yet his skill in
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:2594:170"/> Physicke was confined to one forme of purge, composed of a certaine portion of the Electuarie</hi> Diaphoe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>es, as I was since by our A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pothecarie informed: by which his butcherlike boldnesse he cast many into most dangerous laskes, accompanyed sometimes with diuerse other euill accidents, as I haue heard since from some of themselues: and this chiefly was then to be seene, when this medicine was exhibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to thinne and weake bodies.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now howbeit I could instance in a number of other exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, all tending to the same purpose, yet fearing too much to offend the Readers patience, referring them to some other op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunitie, I thinke it is now high time to turne my sailes to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the shore, and to cast anchor for the present. And the as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembling of so many sage Senators, according to the ancient and laudable custome of this kingdome, to apply fit salues to the festered sores of the same, putteth me in good hope of some redresse, as well of the abuses here complained of, as of diuers other disorders. I am not indeed ignorant, that affaires of high consequence, are to be handled in this honorable assemblie. And yet I hope the life of man is not a matter of smallest mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. <hi>Agitur de corio humano.</hi> Skinne for skinne,<note place="margin">Iob 2.16.</note> and all that a man hath will he giue for his life. Let this Gangrene there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in time be looked to, lest it grow to a greater euill. Since therefore errors of this kind are so full of danger, as hath bene both in the precedent, &amp; now in this present discourse plainly prooued, both by a great and smaller enquest, of such persons with whose worth the delinquents I am sure dare not compare, I wish it may not be forgotten. <hi>Sed verbum sat sapienti.</hi> A word, yea a nod, is enough to a wise man. And therefore I leaue it to your Honourable considerations. CONSIDER THE MATTER, CONSVLT, AND GIVE SENTENCE.</p>
